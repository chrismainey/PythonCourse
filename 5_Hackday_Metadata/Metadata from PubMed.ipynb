Emergent evaluation of fever allows early treatment of potentially fatal infections. Limited data exist regarding caregiver adherence to physician recommendations of prompt medical evaluation of fever in children with SCD. Better understanding of parental behavior around fever management may inform improved models for support in families of children with SCD.</AbstractText>\n",
      "                <AbstractText Label=\"PROCEDURE\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">Cross-sectional survey based on health belief domains, Wake Forest trust scales, and self-reported adherence among 163 caregivers of children with SCD during routine hematology visit.</AbstractText>\n",
      "                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">Fifty-five percent of caregivers were adherent to fever evaluation recommendations as defined by &quot;always&quot; seeking medical evaluation of fever in their child with SCD. Perceived susceptibility to fever/infection, benefits of prompt evaluation, and cues to action were significantly different between those who adhere to recommendations versus those who do not. Twenty-five percent believe their child does not need antibiotics with every fever whereas 17% believe their child does not need evaluation of fever after immunizations. Fifty-seven percent report their employer understands missing work whereas 25% report concern regarding cost of evaluation. Trust in their child's hematologist and medical profession was high (composite scores 23.4/25 and 21/25, respectively).</AbstractText>\n",
      "                <AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSION\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Despite a high degree of agreement in importance of fever evaluation and high levels of trust, many caregivers do not consistently seek care when their child has a fever. Future studies should address additional barriers to seeking emergency care in children with SCD and fever.</AbstractText>\n",

      "Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at increased risk of death from invasive bacterial infections. Emergent evaluation of fever allows early treatment of potentially fatal infections. Limited data exist regarding caregiver adherence to physician recommendations of prompt medical evaluation of fever in children with SCD. Better understanding of parental behavior around fever management may inform improved models for support in families of children with SCD. Cross-sectional survey based on health belief domains, Wake Forest trust scales, and self-reported adherence among 163 caregivers of children with SCD during routine hematology visit. Fifty-five percent of caregivers were adherent to fever evaluation recommendations as defined by \"always\" seeking medical evaluation of fever in their child with SCD. Perceived susceptibility to fever/infection, benefits of prompt evaluation, and cues to action were significantly different between those who adhere to recommendations versus those who do not. Twenty-five percent believe their child does not need antibiotics with every fever whereas 17% believe their child does not need evaluation of fever after immunizations. Fifty-seven percent report their employer understands missing work whereas 25% report concern regarding cost of evaluation. Trust in their child's hematologist and medical profession was high (composite scores 23.4/25 and 21/25, respectively). Despite a high degree of agreement in importance of fever evaluation and high levels of trust, many caregivers do not consistently seek care when their child has a fever. Future studies should address additional barriers to seeking emergency care in children with SCD and fever.\n"

      "Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at increased risk of death from invasive bacterial infections. Emergent evaluation of fever allows early treatment of potentially fatal infections. Limited data exist regarding caregiver adherence to physician recommendations of prompt medical evaluation of fever in children with SCD. Better understanding of parental behavior around fever management may inform improved models for support in families of children with SCD. Cross-sectional survey based on health belief domains, Wake Forest trust scales, and self-reported adherence among 163 caregivers of children with SCD during routine hematology visit. Fifty-five percent of caregivers were adherent to fever evaluation recommendations as defined by \"always\" seeking medical evaluation of fever in their child with SCD. Perceived susceptibility to fever/infection, benefits of prompt evaluation, and cues to action were significantly different between those who adhere to recommendations versus those who do not. Twenty-five percent believe their child does not need antibiotics with every fever whereas 17% believe their child does not need evaluation of fever after immunizations. Fifty-seven percent report their employer understands missing work whereas 25% report concern regarding cost of evaluation. Trust in their child's hematologist and medical profession was high (composite scores 23.4/25 and 21/25, respectively). Despite a high degree of agreement in importance of fever evaluation and high levels of trust, many caregivers do not consistently seek care when their child has a fever. Future studies should address additional barriers to seeking emergency care in children with SCD and fever.The etiology of fever in rural Lao People's Democratic Republic (Laos) has remained obscure until recently owing to the lack of laboratory facilities. We conducted a study to determine the causes of fever among 229 patients without malaria in Savannakhet Province, southern Laos; 52% had evidence of at least one diagnosis (45% with single and 7% with apparent multiple infections). Among patients with only one diagnosis, dengue (30.1%) was the most common, followed by leptospirosis (7.0%), Japanese encephalitis virus infection (3.5%), scrub typhus (2.6%), spotted fever group infection (0.9%), unspecified flavivirus infection (0.9%), and murine typhus (0.4%). We discuss the empirical treatment of fever in relation to these findings.The aim of this study was to examine how fever during pregnancy is associated with motor development in the child. This cohort study was based on data from females and their children, from the Danish National Birth Cohort, who took part in an 18-month and/or 7-year follow-up study. Information regarding fever (number of episodes, temperature, duration, and pregnancy week) was obtained around gestation week 12 and at the end of pregnancy. Assessments of motor development in early childhood were based on the ages at which the motor milestones 'sitting unsupported' (n=44,256) and 'walking unassisted' (n=53,959) were attained. The Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire 2007 (DCDQ'07) was used to identify children with indication of developmental coordination disorder (DCD) at age 7 years (n=29,401). Any associations between the exposure to fever during pregnancy and motor development were estimated using Cox regression and logistic regression analyses. Fever during pregnancy was reported by 15,234 (28.0%) participants in the 18-month follow-up and by 7965 (26.9%) participants in the 7-year follow-up. Adjusted analyses showed no association between prenatal exposure to fever and either 'sitting unsupported' or 'walking unassisted'. The proportion of children with indication of DCD was 3.1%. The odds ratio of indication of DCD if children were exposed to fever in utero was 1.29 (95% CI 1.12-1.49). However, no dose-response association was found. We found a significant association between maternal fever during pregnancy and DCD in children at age 7 years. The lack of a dose-response association might suggest that this association is explained by the underlying causes of the fever.Acetaminophen is a common therapy for fever in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) who have probable infection, but its effects are unknown. We randomly assigned 700 ICU patients with fever (body temperature, â¥38Â°C) and known or suspected infection to receive either 1 g of intravenous acetaminophen or placebo every 6 hours until ICU discharge, resolution of fever, cessation of antimicrobial therapy, or death. The primary outcome was ICU-free days (days alive and free from the need for intensive care) from randomization to day 28. The number of ICU-free days to day 28 did not differ significantly between the acetaminophen group and the placebo group: 23 days (interquartile range, 13 to 25) among patients assigned to acetaminophen and 22 days (interquartile range, 12 to 25) among patients assigned to placebo (Hodges-Lehmann estimate of absolute difference, 0 days; 96.2% confidence interval [CI], 0 to 1; P=0.07). A total of 55 of 345 patients in the acetaminophen group (15.9%) and 57 of 344 patients in the placebo group (16.6%) had died by day 90 (relative risk, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.39; P=0.84). Early administration of acetaminophen to treat fever due to probable infection did not affect the number of ICU-free days.

Fever was defined as a core body temperature â¥38.0 Â°C and was further categorized as being (1) consecutive fever (fever lasting three or more days) or (2) fever with body temperature â¥39 Â°C. Medical records of patients who underwent total joint arthroplasty (TJA) between November 2009 and February 2012 were retrospectively examined, and those who underwent one primary TJA procedure were considered for inclusion. A total of 980 patients (TKA = 597, THA = 383) were included. Overall, 48.2% of patients experienced fever, most commonly on postoperative day 1, and the maximum body temperature also most commonly occurred on postoperative day 1. Respiratory, urinary tract, periprosthetic, and any infections were significantly associated with consecutive fever (P < 0.05), while respiratory and any infections were significantly associated with fever â¥39 Â°C. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients who experienced infection had a significantly increased risk of postoperative fever (P = 0.001). Consecutive fevers or fever â¥39 Â°C after TJA may be indicative of postoperative infection, and testing to rule out infection should be performed. These results may assist in the differential diagnosis of postoperative fever after TJA and thus help to guide treatment. III.The objective of the present study was to determine whether selective inflammatory cytokine concentrations within cerebrospinal fluid are useful markers for the differential diagnosis of aseptic and bacterial meningitis within neurosurgical patients. Prospective, open-label, observational, cohort study. Neurosurgical ICU, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Thirty-two consecutive neurosurgical patients who had postoperative fever following external ventricular drain insertion for the treatment of brain injury underwent serial cerebrospinal fluid cytokine analysis pre and post fever to determine the value of such markers in ascertaining the differential diagnosis of meningitis. Cerebrospinal fluid samples were collected on the day of fever onset, as well as on day 2 and 4 pre and post fever development. Tumor necrosis factor-Î±, interleukin-1Î², interleukin-6, interleukin-8, transforming growth factor-Î², and procalcitonin were subsequently analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis techniques. Inflammatory marker levels were compared among febrile aseptic, bacterial, and nonmeningitis patients to determine cerebrospinal fluid inflammatory changes over time. Significant increases in cerebrospinal fluid tumor necrosis factor -Î±, interleukin-1Î², interleukin-6, and interleukin-8 levels were observed within patients with bacterial meningitis at fever onset, which was not evident in aseptic or nonmeningitis patients. Furthermore, significant increases in cerebrospinal fluid tumor necrosis factor-Î±, interleukin-1Î², interleukin-6, and interleukin-8 levels were detected as early as 4 days prior to fever onset within patients with bacterial meningitis when compared with both aseptic and nonmeningitis groups. Interestingly, procalcitonin was only significantly increased in patients with bacterial meningitis on the fourth day post fever. The present study suggests that raised cerebrospinal fluid tumor necrosis factor -Î±, interleukin-1Î², and interleukin-8 in a temporal manner may indicate early bacterial meningitis development in neurosurgical patients, enabling earlier diagnostic certainty and improved patient outcomes.Fever is common in malignant tumors. We report an exceptional case of psychogenic fever in a patient with small cell lung cancer. This is the first case report of psychogenic fever in a patient with small cell lung cancer. A 61-year-old Chinese man diagnosed with small cell carcinoma on June 30, 2012, came to our department with a complaint of fever lasting more than 1 month. He had undergone chemoradiotherapy for lung cancer 6 months previously. After admission, his body temperature fluctuated in the range of 37 Â°C to 39 Â°C. Somatic symptoms associated with anxiety were obvious. A 24-item Hamilton Anxiety Scale was used to assess the patient's condition. A score of 32 confirmed a diagnosis of severe anxiety. After a week of antianxiety treatment, the patient's temperature returned to normal. Psychogenic fever is common in cancer patients and deserves more attention. Patients with psychogenic fever must be distinguished from patients with infectious fever (including neutropenic fever), and tumor fever. Additionally, antianxiety or antidepression treatment should be provided. A concern is that continual anxiety may adversely affect anticancer therapy.Accurate determination and detection of fever is essential in the appropriate treatment of pediatric population. It is widely known that improper definitions of fever can cause grave and dangerous consequences in medical procedures. Infrared tympanic thermometry seems a relatively new and popular alternative for traditional measurement in the diagnosis of pediatric fever. However, its accuracy in the diagnosis of fever remains a major concern. Systematic review and meta-analysis. Medline, Ovid, Elsevier, Google Scholar, and Cochrane library. Cross-sectional, prospective design. Two investigators independently assessed selected studies and extracted data. Disagreements were resolved by discussion with other reviewers. A total of 25 articles were included in our meta-analysis. The summary estimates revealed that the pooled sensitivity was 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.68-0.72), pooled specificity was 0.86 (95% CI = 0.85-0.88), and pooled diagnostic odds ratio was 47.3 (95% CI = 29.76-75.18), for the diagnosis of fever using infrared tympanic thermometry. Additionally, the area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.94, and Q* value was 0.87. A total of 25 articles that encompassing 31 studies were analyzed. Based on our meta-analysis, accuracy of infrared tympanic thermometry in diagnosing fever is high. We can cautiously make conclusion that infrared tympanic thermometry should be widely used as fever of thermometer.Hydroxyurea (HU) or hydroxycarbamide is an antimetabolite chemotherapy frequently used in the treatment of chronic myeloproliferative disorders. This treatment is usually well tolerated but a few cases of fever induced by the molecule have been reported in the literature. The aim of the study was to describe the clinical and biological characteristics of HU induced fever. We performed a cross sectional study of patients treated with HU and followed-up in an internal medicine department between 2006 and 2012. We added our cases of HU induced fever with those reported in the literature (Pubmed and Cochrane databases) since 1981. We identified 38 cases of HU induced fever, including our 4 cases. The mean age was 65Â±10.9 years and the sex-ratio 1/2. The fever appeared after a median duration of treatment of 21 days and was usually high (40Â°C) but clinically well tolerated. A biological inflammatory syndrome (CRP: 131Â±92 mg/L) was constant and one third of the patients also presented with hepatitis or lung disease. A probabilistic antibiotic treatment was introduced for 34% of the patients. For the half of the patients, HU-reintroduction test was performed, and was positive for all the patients but one. As soon as HU was withdrawn, the fever disappeared in a median of 24 hours. HU induced fever is unusual. Clinical presentation is very stereotyped. When this adverse effect is suspected, an infectious disease must first be ruled out. If infection is excluded, HU has to be stopped.To test the hypothesis that fever was more frequent in critically ill patients with brain injury when compared to nonneurological patients and to study its effect on in-hospital case fatality. Retrospective matched cohort study utilizing a single-center prospectively compiled registry. Critically ill neurological patients â¥18 years and consecutively admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute ischemic stroke (AIS), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and traumatic brain injury (TBI) were selected. Patients were matched by sex, age, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE-II) to a cohort of nonneurological patients. Fever was defined as any temperature â¥37.5Â°C within the first 24 hours upon admission to the ICU. The primary outcome measure was in-hospital case fatality. Mean age among neurological patients was 65.6 Â± 15 years, 46% were men, and median APACHE-II was 15 (interquartile range 11-20). There were 18% AIS, 27% ICH, and 6% TBI. More neurological patients experienced fever than nonneurological patients (59% vs 47%, P = .007). The mean hospital length of stay was higher for nonneurological patients (18 Â± 20 vs 14 Â± 15 days, P = .007), and more neurological patients were dead at hospital discharge (29% vs 20%, P < .0001). After risk factor adjustment, diagnosis (neurological vs nonneurological), and the probability of being exposed to fever (propensity score), the following variables were associated with higher in-hospital case fatality: APACHE-II, neurological diagnosis, mean arterial pressure, cardiovascular and respiratory dysfunction in ICU, and fever (odds ratio 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.04-3.6, P = .04). These data suggest that fever is a frequent occurrence after brain injury, and that it is independently associated with in-hospital case fatality.Antibiotic escalations are frequently guided by fever persistence. Unnecessary antibiotic escalation is associated with resistance induction. We examined whether fever persistence is associated with adverse outcomes among medical inpatients with sepsis. In a single-center prospective cohort study, we included consecutive medical inpatients with suspected or documented bacterial infections. Data were collected on days 0, 2, 4, and 30 days from episode onset. We examined the association between fever persistence at 4 days and 30-day mortality on univariate and multivariate analysis. Inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment (IAET) was defined for patients with microbiologically documented infections (MDIs). Odds ratios (ORs) are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of 1,621 patients were included. Among patients with MDIs, 38/206 (18.4%) given appropriate empiric therapy had continued fever on day 4, compared to 64/231 (27.7%) of patients receiving IAET, OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37-0.93. Fever persistence was not associated with mortality after adjustment for other risk factors. Among patients with presumed sepsis who did not have MDIs, persistent fever was significantly associated with 30-day mortality on a multivariate analysis, adjusted OR 2.77 (95% CI 1.78-4.31). Other risk factors for mortality included older age, nosocomial infections, malignancy, dyspnea, shock, decreased albumin, and elevated creatinine. For patients with MDIs, fever persistence for up to 4 days is a marker of IAET, but is not associated with mortality, and should not, in itself, trigger antibiotic escalation. For patients without MDIs, fever persistence should trigger careful re-evaluation, as it is associated with mortality.The objective was to study the variation in pediatric emergency department (PED) practice patterns for evaluation and management of children with sickle cell disease (SCD) and fever in U.S. children's hospitals. A cross-sectional study of visits by children 3 months to 18 years of age with SCD and fever evaluated in 36 U.S. children's hospital PEDs within the 2010 Pediatric Health Information System database. The main outcome measures were the proportions of SCD visits that received evaluation (laboratory testing and chest radiographs [CXRs]) and treatment (parenteral administration of antibiotics) and were admitted for fever. Of the 4,853 PED visits for SCD and fever, 91.7% had complete blood counts (CBCs), 93.8% had reticulocyte counts, 93% had blood cultures obtained, 68.5% had CXRs, and 91.7% received antibiotics. Most (81.4%) patients received the recommended National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute evaluation (CBC, reticulocyte count, and blood culture) and treatment (parenteral antibiotics). In multivariate regression modeling controlling for hospital- and patient-level effects, age groups â¥1 to <5 years (odds ratio [OR] = 0.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.25 to 0.40) and â¥5 to <13 years (OR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.32 to 0.50), and those visits that did not have CXRs had lower odds of hospital admission. After adjusting for age, payor status, receipt of laboratory testing, antibiotics, and CXRs, admission rates varied by sevenfold across U.S. children's hospitals (p < 0.001). Standardization of practice exists across children's hospitals regarding obtaining laboratory studies and administering antibiotics for patients with SCD and fever. However, admission rates vary significantly. Evaluating the causes and consequences of such significant variation needs further exploration to improve the quality of care for patients with SCD.To develop and validate a predictive risk calculator algorithm that assesses the probability of flare versus infection in febrile patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We evaluated SLE patients admitted because of fever in the Department of Autoimmune Diseases of our Hospital between January 2000 and February 2013. Included patients were those with final diagnosis of infection, SLE flare or both. Data on clinical manifestations, treatment and laboratory results were collected. Variables considered clinically relevant were used to build up all possible logistic regression models to differentiate flares from infections. Best predictive variables for SLE relapses based on their higher area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) were selected to be included in the calculator. The algorithm was developed in a random sample of 60% the cohort and validated in the remaining 40%. One hundred and thirty SLE patients presented 210 episodes of fever. Fever was attributed to SLE activity and to infection in 45% and 48% of the cases, respectively. Three independent variables for prediction of flares were consistently selected by multivariate analysis: days of fever, anti-dsDNA antibody titres and C-reactive protein levels. Combination of these variables resulted in an algorithm with calculated AUC of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.87 to 0.97). The AUC for the validation cohort was of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.68 to 0.91). The proposed flare risk predictive calculator could be a useful diagnostic tool for differentiation between flares and infections in febrile SLE patients.Numerous factors affect the response to vitamin K antagonists (VKA) including age, dietary vitamin K, other drugs, pharmacogenetics, and disease states. In antithrombotic guidelines, fever is mentioned as a factor that may increase response to VKA. The purpose of this article is to review the available evidence regarding the effect of fever on response to VKA, and to discuss possible mechanisms of this effect. We performed a search of the English literature from 1943 to June 2014, using the key words fever AND warfarin, acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon, coumarin anticoagulants and VKA; fever AND vitamin K dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. One animal investigation and 6 studies in humans suggest fever increases response to VKA, but one study did not find a significant effect. The magnitude of this effect is variable. Possible mechanisms for the increased effect of VKA associated with fever are increased catabolism of vitamin K dependent clotting factors, decreased vitamin K intake, and inhibition of VKA metabolism. More rigorous studies are needed to confirm that fever increases response to warfarin and other VKA.Many studies have indicated that the reduced folate carrier gene (SLC19A1) is associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects (NTDs). However, the interaction between the SLC19A1 gene variant and maternal fever exposure and NTD risk remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the risk for NTDs was influenced by the interactions between the SLC19A1 (rs1051266) variant and maternal first trimester fever. We investigated the potential interaction between maternal first trimester fever and maternal or offspring SLC19A1 polymorphism through a population-based case-control study. One hundred and four nuclear families with NTDs and 100 control families with nonmal newborns were included in the study. SLC19A1 polymorphism was determined using polymerase chain reaction-restricted fragment length polymorphism. Mothers who had the GG/GA genotype and first trimester fever had an elevated risk of NTDs (adjusted odds ratio, 11.73; 95% confidence interval, 3.02-45.58) as compared to absence of maternal first trimester fever and AA genotype after adjusting for maternal education, paternal education, and age, and had a significant interactive coefficient (Î³ = 3.17) between maternal GG/GA genotype and first trimester fever. However, there was no interaction between offspring's GG/GA genotype and maternal first trimester fever (the interactive coefficient Î³ = 0.97) after adjusting for confounding factors. Our findings suggested that the risk of NTDs was potentially influenced by a gene-environment interaction between maternal SLC19A1 rs1051266 GG/GA genotype and first trimester fever. Maternal GG/GA genotype may strengthen the effect of maternal fever exposure on NTD risk in this Chinese population.Despite the frequent use and radiation exposure of computed tomography (CT) scans, there is little information on patterns of CT use and their utility in the management of pediatric patients with fever and neutropenia (FN). We examined the contribution of either the commonly employed pan-CT (multiple anatomical locations) or targeted CT (single location) scanning to identify possible infectious etiologies in this challenging clinical scenario. Procedure Pediatric patients with an underlying malignancy admitted for fever (temperature â¥ 38.3 Â°C) and an absolute neutrophil count <500 cells/Î¼L from 2003-2009 were included. Risk factors associated with utilization, results, and effects on clinical management of CT scans were identified. Results Charts for 635 admissions for FN from 263 patients were reviewed. Overall, 139 (22%) admissions (93 individuals) had at least one scan. Of 188 scans, 103 (55%) were pan-scans. Changes in management were most strongly associated with the identification of evidence consistent with infection (OR = 12.64, 95% CI: 5.05-31.60, P < 0.001). Seventy-eight (41%) of all CT scans led to a change in clinical management, most commonly relating to use of antibiotic (N = 41, 53%) or antifungal/antiviral medications (N = 33, 42%). The odds of a change in clinical management did not differ for those receiving a pan-scan compared to those receiving a targeted scan (OR = 1.23; 95% CI, 0.61-2.46; P = 0.57). Conclusions When CT is clinically indicated, it is important for clinicians to strongly consider utilizing a targeted scan to reduce radiation exposure to patients as well as to decrease costs without compromising care.The role of fever in trauma patients remains unclear. Fever occurs as a response to release of cytokines and prostaglandins by white blood cells. Many factors, including trauma, can trigger release of these factors. To determine whether (1) fever in the first 48 hours is related to a favorable outcome in trauma patients and (2) fever is more common in patients with head trauma. Retrospective study of trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit for at least 2 days. Data were analyzed by using multivariate analysis. Of 162 patients studied, 40% had fever during the first 48 hours. Febrile patients had higher mortality rates than did afebrile patients. When adjusted for severity of injuries, fever did not correlate with mortality. Neither the incidence of fever in the first 48 hours after admission to the intensive care unit nor the number of days febrile in the unit differed between patients with and patients without head trauma (traumatic brain injury). About 70% of febrile patients did not have a source found for their fever. Febrile patients without an identified source of infection had lower peak white blood cell counts, lower maximum body temperature, and higher minimum platelet counts than did febrile patients who had an infectious source identified. The most common infection was pneumonia. No relationship was found between the presence of fever during the first 48 hours and mortality. Patients with traumatic brain injury did not have a higher incidence of fever than did patients without traumatic brain injury. About 30% of febrile patients had an identifiable source of infection. Further studies are needed to understand the origin and role of fever in trauma patients.Fever is frequently observed in conjunction with interleukin-2 (IL-2)-based immunotherapy. Traditionally, fever has been regarded as an undesirable side effect and treated with fever-lowering drugs. However, new insights in tumor immunology suggest that elevated temperature may facilitate a more effective antitumor immune response. The purpose of this retrospective study was to examine the potential role of the IL-2-induced fever in melanoma patients treated with or without paracetamol in two consecutive cohorts. One hundred and seventy-nine patients with metastatic melanoma treated with a modified decrescendo regimen of IL-2 and Interferon (IFN) between 2004 and 2010 were retrospectively studied. 87 patients treated before 2007 received paracetamol as part of the treatment schedule, and 92 patients treated after 2007 did not receive paracetamol routinely. Body temperature was analyzed as dichotomized and continuous variables and correlated to objective tumor response and overall survival using logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard analysis. Patients experiencing peak temperature of â¥ 39.5 Â°C had a median OS of 15.2 months compared to 8.7 months among patients with lower temperatures (P = 0.01). In the multivariate analysis, peak temperature of â¥ 39.5 Â°C (HR 0.53; P = 0.026) and high mean temperature (HR 0.56; P = 0.004) were independent prognostic factors for improved survival. We suggest high fever as a biomarker for improved survival in melanoma patients treated with IL-2/IFN. The routine use of fever-reducing drugs during immunotherapy can therefore be questioned. More studies are needed to evaluate the role of fever and the use of antipyretics during cytokine-based immunotherapy.To evaluate the contributing factors for fever after tubeless percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). Between May 2009 and December 2013, 395 tubeless PCNLs were performed at our hospital. After stone extraction, the bleeding points were cauterized for hemostasis to enable tubeless modification. In patients with troublesome bleeding after cauterization, oxidized regenerated cellulose (Surgicel) strips were used to tamponade the access tract to facilitate bleeding control. The contributory factors for fever were evaluated by a retrospective chart review. Forty-four patients (11.7%) developed fever after tubeless PCNL. There was no difference in gender, age, and body mass index in the development of fever. Episodes of febrile or septic urinary tract infection before PCNL were found to have occurred in 35 patients, but the incidence of postoperative fever was not significantly higher in these patients. There is no significant difference in the mean stone size in fever and nonfever patients. Complete staghorn stones were noted in 40 patients, and their fever rate was not significantly higher than patients with nonstaghorn stone. The operation time is not significantly higher in the group with urinary tract infection. Patients with postoperative fever had a high incidence of residual stones than the remaining patients (38.9% vs 20.4%). There was no significant difference in incidence of postoperative fever in patients with struvite stones than patients with nonstruvite stones. In patients who received Surgicel packing, the incidence of fever was not significantly higher. Incomplete stone extraction is a major contributing factor for the development of fever after tubeless PCNL.Fever-associated syndromic epilepsies ranging from febrile seizures plus (FS+) to Dravet syndrome have a significant genetic component. However, apart from SCN1A mutations in >80% of patients with Dravet syndrome, the genetic underpinnings of these epilepsies remain largely unknown. Therefore, we performed a genome-wide screening for copy number variations (CNVs) in 36 patients with SCN1A-negative fever-associated syndromic epilepsies. Phenotypes included Dravet syndrome (n = 23; 64%), genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) and febrile seizures plus (FS+) (n = 11; 31%) and unclassified fever-associated epilepsies (n = 2; 6%). Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was performed using Agilent 4 Ã 180K arrays. We identified 13 rare CNVs in 8 (22%) of 36 individuals. These included known pathogenic CNVs in 4 (11%) of 36 patients: a 1q21.1 duplication in a proband with Dravet syndrome, a 14q23.3 deletion in a proband with FS+, and two deletions at 16p11.2 and 1q44 in two individuals with fever-associated epilepsy with concomitant autism and/or intellectual disability. In addition, a 3q13.11 duplication in a patient with FS+ and two de novo duplications at 7p14.2 and 18q12.2 in a patient with atypical Dravet syndrome were classified as likely pathogenic. Six CNVs were of unknown significance. The identified genomic aberrations overlap with known neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting that fever-associated epilepsy syndromes may be a recurrent clinical presentation of known microdeletion syndromes.To undertake a concept analysis to clarify the meaning of the term 'fever' in children and to identify models of fever-related belief that may help in understanding the response of parents and professionals to fever in children. This concept analysis was undertaken because the approach to the treatment of fever varies widely and in particular that there is often a difference between what parents want for their children, official guidelines and what professionals do in practice. Concept analysis. The study used a modified evolutionary method of concept analysis. The analysis was based on data from medical, nursing, popular and biological literature and used an iterative process to clarify the term. Fever has a number of distinct uses based on its meaning and history; these include its use to indicate an illness itself, as a beneficial symptom associated with disease, and a diagnostic sign. Three models of fever-related practice emerged from the analysis, these being a phobic-fearful approach that drives routine treatment, a scientific approach that sees fever as a potentially adaptive and beneficial response and a scientific but pragmatic approach that recognises potential benefit but results in treatment anyway. These different uses, which are often not clarified, go some way to explaining the different approaches to its treatment. When parents, clinicians, physiologists and guideline writers discuss fever, they attribute different meanings to it, which may go some way to explaining the dissonance between theory and practice. In the absence of new knowledge, the emphasis of practitioners should therefore be on their safe use. When discussing the meaning and treatment of fever, it is important to understand what is meant in different circumstances. The models of fever-related beliefs outlined here may go some way to helping this process.Most illnesses associated with fever are self-limiting and children recover with no specific treatment. However, fever can also be the presenting feature of serious illness, which may be life threatening if not diagnosed and treated appropriately. It is important to establish whether the temperature has been measured and, if so, how. The height of the temperature should be recorded, and always enquire what device has been used, as a reading from a forehead thermometer may not be accurate. While many families will use a thermometer the impression of the child being hot to touch without formal measurement should still be taken seriously. Check whether the child is still feeding or taking fluids adequately. Any child may be irritable when their temperature is high, but a constantly irritable or inconsolable child, or one who is extremely lethargic, drowsy or difficult to rouse is a cause for concern. Ask about any skin changes or rashes the parent may have noticed. Find out what measures the parent may already have taken to manage the fever, and in particular, whether, and at what time, antipyretics have been given. Enquire about contact with infectious illnesses, and foreign travel. Other vital signs, including heart rate, respiratory rate and capillary refill time should also be recorded. The child should be examined for focal signs indicating the site of infection, and hydration should be assessed. Posture, tone, fontanelle (if patent), presence of a rash, neck stiffness and level of consciousness should also be assessed. If the diagnosis is unclear, potentially serious, and specific treatment may be needed to prevent deterioration, the child should be referred.Leptin is an important modulator of both inflammation and energy homeostasis, making it a key interface between the inflammatory response to pathogenic stimuli and the energy status of the host. In previous studies we demonstrated that sickness responses to systemic immune challenge, including fever, are significantly exacerbated in diet induced obese animals. To investigate whether this exacerbation is functionally linked to the obesity associated increase in circulating levels of leptin, a species-specific leptin antiserum (LAS) was used to neutralize endogenous leptin in diet-induced obese adult male Wistar rats treated with a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (100Î¼g/kg). LAS significantly reduced the magnitude of the later phases of the fever response, and attenuated the circulating levels of IL-6, IL-1ra and bioactivity of leptin in the obese animals. In addition, the antiserum significantly attenuated the hypothalamic expression of IL-1Ã, IÎºBÎ±, COX2, SOCS3 and IL-6 in both lean and obese rats 10h after the LPS injection and NF-IL6 in the hypothalamus of obese rats only. The relatively late rise in brain IL-6 suggested a role in mediating the extended fever response in obese animals and we tested this by neutralizing brain IL-6 using an IL6-AS injected intracerebroventricularly (4Î¼l, icv). The IL6-AS significantly but transiently (between 9h and 12h post LPS) reduced the late fever response of obese rats. These results demonstrate that leptin plays an important part in modulating the late portion of the fever response to LPS, likely through the induction of hypothalamic IL-6 in obese animals.Induction of mild therapeutic hypothermia (TH; temperature 32-34Â°C) has become standard of care in many hospitals for comatose survivors of cardiac arrest. Pyrexia, or fever, is known to be detrimental in patients with neurologic injuries such as stroke or trauma. The incidence of pyrexia in the postrewarming phase of TH is unknown. We attempted to determine the incidence of fever after TH and hypothesized that those patients who were febrile after rewarming would have worse clinical outcomes than those who maintained normothermia in the postrewarming period. Retrospective data analysis of survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) over a period of 29 months (December 2007 to April 2010). OHCA, age >18, return of spontaneous circulation, and treatment with TH. traumatic arrest and pregnancy. Data collected included age, sex, neurologic outcome, mortality, and whether the patient developed fever (temperature > 100.4Â°F, 38Â°C) within 24 hours after being fully rewarmed to a normal core body temperature after TH. We used simple descriptive statistics and Fisher exact test to report our findings. A total of 149 patients were identified; of these, 82 (55%) underwent TH. The mean age of the TH cohort was 66 years, and 28 (31%) were female. In all, 54 patients survived for >24 hours after rewarming and were included in the analysis. Among the analyzed cohort, 28 (52%) of 54 developed fever within 24 hours after being rewarmed. Outcome measures included in-hospital mortality as well as neurologic outcome as defined by a dichotomized Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score. When comparing neurologic outcomes between the groups, 16 (57%) of 28 in the postrewarming fever group had a poor outcome (CPC score 3-5), while 15 (58%) of 26 in the no-fever group had a favorable outcome (P = .62). In the fever group, 15 (52%) of 28 died, while in the no-fever group, 14 (54%) of 26 died (P = .62). Among a cohort of patients who underwent mild TH after OHCA, more than half of these patients developed pyrexia in the first 24 hours after rewarming. Although there were no significant differences in outcomes between febrile and nonfebrile patients identified in this study, these findings should be further evaluated in a larger cohort. Future investigations may be needed to determine whether postrewarming temperature management will improve the outcomes in this population.To determine the frequency and clinical significance of postoperative fever in pediatric patients undergoing posterior spinal fusion (PSF). A retrospective chart review was performed for consecutive patients undergoing PSF at a single institution between June 2005 and April 2011, with a minimum of 2-year follow up. Exclusion criteria were previous spine surgery, a combined anterior-posterior approach, and delayed wound closure at the time of surgery. Two hundred and seventy-eight patients with an average age of 13 years (1-22 years) met inclusion criteria, with the following diagnoses: adolescent idiopathic scoliosis 43%, neuromuscular/syndromic scoliosis 39%, congenital scoliosis 11%, spondylolisthesis 4%, and Scheuermann kyphosis 3%. Seventy-two percent (201/278) of patients had a maximum temperature (Tmax) >38(Â°) postoperatively, and 9% (27/278) Tmax >39(Â°). The percentage of febrile patients trended down following the first postoperative day. Infection rate was 4% (12/278). There was no correlation between Tmax >38(Â°) or Tmax >39(Â°), and timing of fever, positive blood or urine cultures, pneumonia, or surgical site infection. Seventy-two percent of pediatric patients undergoing PSF experienced postoperative fever, and 9% of patients had Tmax>39(Â°). There was no significant correlation between fever and positive blood culture, urine culture, pneumonia, or surgical site infection. This information may help relieve stress for families and healthcare providers, and obviate routine laboratory evaluation for fever alone.To investigate the attitudes of nurses caring for hospitalised adult patients towards fever and antipyresis and to identify the predictors of these attitudes. Fever is a host defence mechanism, whose harmful effects are limited to specific patients. Findings about antipyretic treatment have further challenged the need for routine or aggressive fever suppression. Unfortunately, nurses continue to be fever phobic, while their attitudes towards fever and antipyresis considerably affect antipyretic practice. Prospective, cross-sectional, multicentre survey. A convenience sample of registered and assistant nurses employed in surgical/medical wards and intensive care units of nine Greek hospitals was enrolled. The developed questionnaire included 10 multiple-choice, knowledge-evaluating items about fever and antipyresis, 10 Likert-type attitude-evaluating items towards fever and 10 towards antipyresis. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify the predictors of attitudes towards fever and antipyresis. The attitudes of the 458 participants were found to be relatively positive towards both fever and antipyresis. Lower fever/antipyresis knowledge score predicted both negative attitude towards fever (p = 0Â·001) and positive attitude towards antipyresis (p < 0Â·001), while longer professional experience predicted positive attitude towards antipyresis (p = 0Â·002). Advancing nurses' evidence-based knowledge about fever and antipyresis is expected to limit their tendency to overtreat fever and favour fever care based on the assessment of actual patient demands. These findings highlight the need for continuing education programmes to eliminate fever phobia and improve nurses' competency for individualised fever care.To evaluate and compare the management approaches of pediatric and general emergency medicine physicians in infants presenting to the emergency department (ED) with complaint of fever. Infants 90 days of age or younger with a chief complaint of fever were included for review. Vital signs, laboratory workup, disposition, and final diagnosis were collected. Compliance with guidelines was assessed and compared between EDs. Compliance with admission guidelines was not significantly different in any of the 3 age groups evaluated between the pediatric and general ED (PED and GED). Compliance with guideline recommendations for laboratory workup was not significantly different between the 2 EDs, nor was overall compliance with guideline recommendations. No significant variations in the management of febrile infants or compliance with published guidelines between PED and GED physicians were observed. Young infants can be safely treated for fever in the PED or GED.Fever is associated with a poor outcome in severely brain-injured patients, and its control is one of the therapies used in this condition. But, fever suppression may promote infection, and severely brain-injured patients are frequently exposed to infectious diseases, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Therefore, we designed a study to explore the role of a fever control protocol in VAP development during neuro-intensive care. An observational study was performed on severely brain-injured patients hospitalized in a university ICU. The primary goal was to assess whether fever control was a risk factor for VAP in a prospective cohort in which a fever control protocol was applied and in a historical control group. Moreover, the density of VAP incidence was compared between the two groups. The statistical analysis was based on a competing risk model multivariate analysis. The study included 189 brain-injured patients (intervention group, n = 98, and historical control group, n = 91). The use of a fever control protocol was an independent risk factor for VAP (hazard ratio 2.73, 95% confidence interval (1.38, 5.38; P = 0.005)). There was a significant increase in the incidence of VAP in patients treated with a fever control protocol (26.1 versus 12.5 VAP cases per 1000 days of mechanical ventilation). In cases in which a fever control protocol was applied for > 3 days, we observed a higher rate of VAP in comparison with the rate among patients treated for â¤ 3 days. Fever control in brain-injured patients was a major risk factor for VAP occurrence, particularly when applied for > 3 days.Lassa fever is a rodent-borne zoonosis that clinically manifests as an acute hemorrhagic fever. It is treated using ribavarin. Surviving Lassa fever without receiving the antiviral drug ribavarin is rare. Only few cases have been documented to date. We report a case of a 59-year old female with fever who was initially thought to have acute pyelonephritis and sepsis syndrome with background malaria. Further changes in her clinical state and laboratory tests led to a suspicion of Lassa fever. However at the time her laboratory confirmatory test for Lassa fever returned, her clinical state had improved and she made full recovery without receiving ribavarin. Her close contacts showed no evidence of Lassa virus infection. This report adds to the literature on the natural history of Lassa fever; and that individuals may survive Lassa fever with conservative management of symptoms of the disease and its complications.To explore the correlation between MBL ExonI 54 and NFÎºB1-94ins/del ATTG polymorphism and fever during neutropenia in patients with acute leukaemia (AL) (except M3) after first chemotherapy in Chinese Han population. Blood samples obtained from 76 fever patients with AL during neutropenia episodes were detected to analyse single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the MBL ExonI 54 and NFÎºB1-94ins/del ATTG gene, and analyse the correlation between above-mentioned 2 polymorphisms and fever during neutropenia of AL patients after chemotherapy. In 76 patients, no correlation were found between MBL ExonI 54 and NFÎºB1-94ins/del ATTG polymorphism and fever during neutropenia in patients with acute leukaemia after chemotherapy (P > 0.05). No significant relation were found in sex, age, underlying disease, disease status or degrees of neutropenia in febrile neutropenia between MBL ExonI 54 and NFÎºB1-94ins/del ATTG polymorphism (P > 0.05). However, patients with MBL ExonI 54 mutation presented longer febrile duration with a median of 5 days compared to 3 days of patients with wildtype MBL ExonI 54 genotype (P < 0.05). There is no clear correlation between MBL ExonI 54 and NFÎºB1-94ins/del ATTG polymorphism and fever during neutropenia in patients with acute leukaemia after chemotherapy. However, the patients with MBL ExonI 54 mutation have been observed to present a longer febrile duration.Serum samples from patients in Kenya with febrile illnesses were screened for antibodies against bacteria that cause spotted fever, typhus, and scrub typhus. Seroprevalence was 10% for spotted fever group, <1% for typhus group, and 5% for scrub typhus group. Results should help clinicians expand their list of differential diagnoses for undifferentiated fevers.To determine whether the input of time from fever onset will change the accuracy of C-reactive protein (CRP) in diagnosing bacterial infections in febrile children. We performed a prospective observational study on febrile children presenting to the emergency department. The diagnostic performance of CRP at different time points from fever onset was compared using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Among 373 patients included, 103 (28%) had bacterial infection. The optimal cut-off for CRP suggesting bacterial infection changed with time from fever onset: 6âmg/dL for >12-24âh of fever; 10.7 and 12.6âmg/dL at >24-48 and >48âh of fever, respectively. The input of time from fever onset improved the area under the ROC curve from 0.83 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.88) for CRP overall to 0.87 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.96) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.97) at >24-48 and >48âh of fever, respectively. Duration of fever mostly affected the ability of CRP to correctly rule out bacterial infections. CRP level of 2âmg/dL obtained at â¤24âh of fever corresponds with a post-test probability for bacterial infection of 10%, whereas the same value obtained >24âh of fever reduces the risk to 2%. Clinicians should apply different CRP cut-off values depending on whether they are trying to rule in or rule out bacterial infection, but also depending on fever duration at the time of CRP testing.Paratyphoid fever can be complicated by massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding with ileocolonic ulcerations, which are commonly localized using colonoscopy. The most common manifestations include multiple, variable-sized, round or oval-shaped, punched-out ulcers. Occasionally, massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding can occur from erosion of blood vessels. We present a rare case of severe lower gastrointestinal bleeding due to paratyphoid A fever that was successfully controlled with hemoclippings. A 30-year-old man experienced high fever and hematochezia whose blood culture showed Salmonella paratyphi A. A complete colonoscopy was successfully performed up to the level of the terminal ileum, which showed multiple, shallow, ulcerated lesions over the entire terminal ileum. A bleeding vessel was seen in one of the ulcers, with overlaying blood clots. Endoscopic hemostasis was successfully performed with four pieces of endoclip and without immediate complication. This report highlights the use of colonoscopy and endoscopic therapy with endoclips for lower gastrointestinal bleeding, which should be considered before surgery.Antibiotic delivery to patients with fever and neutropenia (F&N) in <60 min is an increasingly important quality measure for oncology centers, but several published reports indicate that a time to antibiotic delivery (TTA) of <60 min is quite difficult to achieve. Here we report a quality improvement (QI) effort that sought to decrease TTA and assess associated clinical outcomes in pediatric patients with cancer and F&N. We used Lean-Methodology and a Plan-Do-Study-Act approach to direct QI efforts and prospectively tracked TTA measures and associated clinical outcomes (length of stay, duration of fever, use of imaging studies to search for occult infection, bacteremia, intensive care unit (ICU) consultation or admission, and mortality). We then performed statistical analysis to determine the impact of our QI interventions on total TTA, sub-process times, and clinical outcomes. Our QI interventions significantly improved TTA such that we are now able to deliver antibiotics in <60 min nearly 100% of the time. All TTA sub-process times also improved. Moreover, achieving TTA <60 min significantly reduced the need for ICU consultation or admission (P = 0.003) in this population. Here we describe our QI effort along with a detailed assessment of several associated clinical outcomes. These data indicate that decreasing TTA to <60 min is achievable and associated with improved outcomes in pediatric patients with cancer and F&N.Drug-induced toxic myopathy is a complication of familial Mediterranean fever in patients who receive colchicine, especially when combined with cyclosporine. Protracted febrile myalgia syndrome is a severe form of familial Mediterranean fever. A 34-year-old man who had familial Mediterranean fever for > 15 years developed kidney failure because of secondary amyloidosis. He received living-unrelated-donor kidney transplant that functioned normally. He was on colchicine prophylaxis that was continued after transplant, and he received immuno-suppression induction with antithymocyte globulin and maintenance with prednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclosporine. After 2 months, he presented with severe myopathy and elevated creatine kinase. Muscle biopsy showed evidence of drug-induced toxic myopathy, most likely caused by cyclosporine in combination with colchicine. Cyclosporine was replaced with sirolimus and colchicine was stopped. Symptoms partially improved and creatine kinase decreased to normal. The prednisolone dosage was reduced gradually to 5 mg daily. At 8 months after transplant, he was readmitted because of severe arthralgia, prolonged fever, pleuritic chest pain, diffuse abdominal pain, purpuric rash, macroscopic hematuria, proteinuria, and diarrhea. The C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated. The clinical diagnosis was recurrent familial Mediterranean fever presenting as protracted febrile myalgia syndrome. Despite the history of toxic myopathy, he was restarted on colchicine (0.5 mg, twice daily), and colchicine was well tolerated. There was marked improvement of most symptoms within several days. Follow-up 5 years later showed normal kidney graft function and no familial Mediterranean fever activity on colchicine prophylaxis. In summary, familial Mediterranean fever reactivation and protracted febrile myalgia syndrome after kidney transplant may be treated with colchicine and modulation of immunosuppressive therapy.Fevers often arise after redo fundoplication with hiatal hernia repair. WeÂ reviewed our experience to evaluate the yield of a fever work-up in this population. We performed a retrospective review of children undergoing redo Nissen fundoplication with hiatal hernia repair between December 2001 and September 2012. Temperatures and fever evaluations of those children receiving a mesh repair were compared with those without mesh. A fever defined as temperature â¥38.4Â°C. Fifty one children received 46 laparoscopic, 4 open, and 1 laparoscopic converted to open procedures. Biosynthetic mesh was used in 25 children whereas 26 underwent repair without mesh. A fever occurred in 56% of those repaired with mesh compared with 23.1% without mesh (PÂ =Â 0.02). A fever evaluation was conducted in 32% of those with mesh compared with 11.5% without mesh (PÂ =Â 0.52). A urinary tract infection was identified in one child after mesh use and an infection was identified in two children without mesh, one pneumonia and one wound infection (PÂ =Â 1). In those repaired with mesh, there was no significant difference in maximum temperature. Fever is common after redo Nissen fundoplication with hiatal hernia repair and occurs more frequently, and with higher temperatures in those with mesh. Fever work-up in these patients is unlikely to yield an infectious source and is attributed to the extensive dissection during the redo procedure.Our randomized controlled trial of a multifaceted evidence-based intervention for improving the inpatient management of fever, hyperglycemia, and swallowing dysfunction in the first three-days following stroke improved outcomes at 90 days by 15%. We designed a quantitative process evaluation to further explain and illuminate this finding. Blinded retrospective medical record audits were undertaken for patients from 19 stroke units prior to and following the implementation of three multidisciplinary evidence-based protocols (supported by team-building workshops, and site-based education and support) for the management of fever (temperature â¥37Â·5Â°C), hyperglycemia (glucose >11âmmol/l), and swallowing dysfunction in intervention stroke units. Data from 1804 patients (718 preintervention; 1086 postintervention) showed that significantly more patients admitted to hospitals allocated to the intervention group received care according to the fever (nâ=â186 of 603, 31% vs. nâ=â74 of 483, 15%, Pâ<â0Â·001), hyperglycemia (nâ=â22 of 603, 3Â·7% vs. nâ=â3 of 483, 0Â·6%, Pâ=â0Â·01), and swallowing dysfunction protocols (nâ=â241 of 603, 40% vs. nâ=â19 of 483, 4Â·0%, Pââ¤â0Â·001). Significantly more patients in these intervention stroke units received four-hourly temperature monitoring (nâ=â222 of 603, 37% vs. nâ=â90 of 483, 19%, Pâ<â0Â·001) and six-hourly glucose monitoring (194 of 603, 32% vs. 46 of 483, 9Â·5%, Pâ<â0Â·001) within 72 hours of admission to a stroke unit, and a swallowing screen (242 of 522, 46% vs. 24 of 350, 6Â·8%, Pââ¤â0Â·0001) within the first 24 hours of admission to hospital. There was no difference between the groups in the treatment of patients with fever with paracetamol (22 of 105, 21% vs. 38 of 131, 29%, Pâ=â0Â·78) or their hyperglycemia with insulin (40 of 100, 40% vs. 17 of 57, 30%, Pâ=â0Â·49). Our intervention resulted in better protocol adherence in intervention stroke units, which explains our main trial findings of improved patient 90-day outcomes. Although monitoring practices significantly improved, there was no difference between the groups in the treatment of fever and hyperglycemia following acute stroke. A significant link between improved treatment practices and improved outcomes would have explained further the success of our intervention, and we are still unable to explain definitively the large improvements in death and dependency found in the main trial results. One potential explanation is that improved monitoring may have led to better overall surveillance of deteriorating patients and faster initiation of treatments not measured as part of the main trial.Fever is a cardinal symptom of infectious or inflammatory insults, but it can also arise from noninfectious causes. The fever-inducing agent that has been used most frequently in experimental studies designed to characterize the physiological, immunological and neuroendocrine processes and to identify the neuronal circuits that underlie the manifestation of the febrile response is lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Our knowledge of the mechanisms of fever production and lysis is largely based on this model. Fever is usually initiated in the periphery of the challenged host by the immediate activation of the innate immune system by LPS, specifically of the complement (C) cascade and Toll-like receptors. The first results in the immediate generation of the C component C5a and the subsequent rapid production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The second, occurring after some delay, induces the further production of PGE2 by induction of its synthesizing enzymes and transcription and translation of proinflammatory cytokines. The Kupffer cells (Kc) of the liver seem to be essential for these initial processes. The subsequent transfer of the pyrogenic message from the periphery to the brain is achieved by neuronal and humoral mechanisms. These pathways subserve the genesis of early (neuronal signals) and late (humoral signals) phases of the characteristically biphasic febrile response to LPS. During the course of fever, counterinflammatory factors, \"endogenous antipyretics,\" are elaborated peripherally and centrally to limit fever in strength and duration. The multiple interacting pro- and antipyretic signals and their mechanistic effects that underlie endotoxic fever are the subjects of this review.Fever and hypothermia (dysthermia) are associated with poor outcomes in patients with brain injuries. The authors sought to study the epidemiology of dysthermia on admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and the effect on in-hospital case fatality in a mixed cohort of patients with brain injuries. The authors conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study in 94 ICUs in the United States. Critically ill patients with neurological injuries, including acute ischemic stroke (AIS), aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and traumatic brain injury (TBI), who were older than 17 years and consecutively admitted to the ICU from 2003 to 2008 were selected for analysis. In total, 13,587 patients were included in this study; AIS was diagnosed in 2973 patients (22%), ICH in 4192 (31%), aSAH in 2346 (17%), and TBI in 4076 (30%). On admission to the ICU, fever was more common among TBI and aSAH patients, and hypothermia was more common among ICH patients. In-hospital case fatality was more common among patients with hypothermia (OR 12.7, 95% CI 8.4-19.4) than among those with fever (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.7-2.1). Compared with patients with ICH (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.8-2.3), TBI (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.8), and aSAH (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.7), patients with AIS who developed fever had the highest risk of death (OR 3.1, 95% CI 2.5-3.7). Although all hypothermic patients had an increased mortality rate, this increase was not significantly different across subgroups. In a multivariable analysis, when adjusted for all other confounders, exposure to fever (adjusted OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5) or hypothermia (adjusted OR 7.8, 95% CI 3.9-15.4) on admission to the ICU was found to be significantly associated with in-hospital case fatality. Fever is frequently encountered in the acute phase of brain injury, and a small proportion of patients with brain injuries may also develop spontaneous hypothermia. The effect of fever on mortality rates differed by neurological diagnosis. Both early spontaneous fever and hypothermia conferred a higher risk of in-hospital death after brain injury.We examined the incidence of and factors associated with fever, as well as the frequency of bacteremia, in patients who had undergone endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for colorectal tumor. A total of 199 patients (120 male and 79 female) were included. The patients were classified into two groups based on the body temperature on the day after ESD treatment: group A, body temperature <37 Â°C; and group B, body temperature â¥37 Â°C. The following factors were analyzed to determine their potential association with post-ESD fever: gender, age, tumor size, form, location, and presence or absence of intraoperative perforation. In addition, blood samples from 50 patients were obtained for blood culture and 16S rRNA gene analysis by polymerase chain reaction. Group A included 106 patients (70 male and 36 female), with a median age of 63 years. Group B included 93 patients (50 male and 43 female), with a median age of 70 years. The incidence of post-ESD fever in the entire cohort was 46.7%. Univariate analysis based on comparison between groups A and B showed that the following factors were significantly associated with post-ESD fever: age [mean Â± standard deviation (SD)], 64.5 Â± 9.2 versus 68.5 Â± 10.8 years, P = 0.006; and tumor size (mean Â± SD) 30.6 Â± 10.8 versus 39.1 Â± 16.6 mm, P < 0.001. Logistic regression analysis for post-ESD fever also found that age {odds ratio 1.04 (95% CI [1.01-1.07], P = 0.009)} and lesion size {odds ratio 1.05 (95% CI [1.03-1.08], P = 0.0002)} were closely associated with post-ESD fever. Of the 50 patients who had blood samples cultured and 16S rRNA gene analyzed, bacteria in blood culture and the 16S rRNA gene were not detectable in any of the samples from the 50 patients. This study indicated that older patients and patients with large tumors were more likely to develop post-ESD fever, but there was a low probability that bacteremia was the cause of fever.This study aims to explore the curative effect of traditional Chinese medicine treating low-grade fever of children caused by respiratory system infection. Sixty children who suffered low-grade fever caused by respiratory system infection were selected and divided into treatment group and control group randomly, each with 30 cases. Control group was treated with conventional methods including oxygen uptake, nebulization and anti-infection, etc, while treatment group was given boil-free granules of traditional Chinese medicine besides the treatment which control group received. Then clinical curative effect of two groups was compared. Results showed that 28 cases (93.3%) were cured in treatment group; while 21 cases (70.0%) were cured in control group. Compared with control group, the treatment group showed up better treatment efficiency and the difference between groups was of statistical significance (P<0.05). Comparison of results of two groups suggested that, traditional Chinese medicine granules has satisfactory curative effect in the treatment of low-grade fever of children caused by respiratory system infection; characterized by short treatment cycle and effective treatment effect, Chinese medicine granules in the combination with oxygen atomization inhalation is proved to be able to efficiently remit symptoms such as coughing, gasp and labored breathing, with outstanding curative effect in the treatment of low-grade fever of children caused by respiratory system infection, thus it is worthy of popularization and application clinically.We used Demographic and Health Survey data to describe the 2-week period prevalence of fever, cough, and diarrhea among children aged < 5 years in low-resources areas. We then explored the relationship between prevalence of isolated fever and national malaria risk. Fever and isolated fever occurred in 26.7% and 7.0% of children, respectively, and was not fully explained by malaria.To validate the Auto-Inflammatory Diseases Activity Index (AIDAI) in the four major hereditary recurrent fever syndromes (HRFs): familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). In 2010, an international collaboration established the content of a disease activity tool for HRFs. Patients completed a 1-month prospective diary with 12 yes/no items before a clinical appointment during which their physician assessed their disease activity by a questionnaire. Eight international experts in auto-inflammatory diseases evaluated the patient's disease activity by a blinded web evaluation and a nominal group technique consensus conference, with their consensus judgement considered the gold standard. Sensitivity/specificity/accuracy measures and the ability of the score to discriminate active from inactive patients via the best cut-off score were calculated by a receiver operating characteristic analysis. Consensus was achieved for 98/106 (92%) cases (39 FMF, 35 CAPS, 14 TRAPS and 10 MKD), with 26 patients declared as having inactive disease and 72 as having active disease. The median total AIDAI score was 14 (range=0-175). An AIDAI cut-off score â¥9 discriminated active from inactive patients, with sensitivity/specificity/accuracy of 89%/92%/90%, respectively, and an area under the curve of 98% (95% CI 96% to 100%). The AIDAI score is a valid and simple tool for assessing disease activity in FMF/MKD/TRAPS/CAPS. This tool is easy to use in clinical practice and has the potential to be used as the standard efficacy measure in future clinical trials.Baicalin, which is a flavonoid compound isolated from Scutellariae radix, has significant antipyretic effects. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of baicalin on the Toll-like receptor 2/4 (TLR2/4) signaling pathway in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of a rat fever model induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with 100Î¼g/kg LPS with or without a 160mg/kg baicalin treatment to induce fever. The results showed that baicalin significantly reduced the body temperatures of the fever-induced rats, inhibited the LPS-modulated upregulation of TLR4 mRNA and protein expression and TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² mRNA expression in the rat PBMCs and downregulated nuclear factor-ÎºB activation with simultaneous decreases in TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² protein expression. The LPS and baicalin had no significant effect on TLR2 mRNA or protein expression in the PBMCs. These data suggest that baicalin can inhibit the TLR4 signaling pathway in the PBMCs of our animal model. Our findings may provide new mechanistic insights into the antipyretic effects of baicalin.Levetiracetam is considered by many clinicians to be one of the most benign antiepileptic medications available. We report the case of a 24-year-old man presenting with seizures for which he was started on levetiracetam. Despite an extensive work-up and treatment of possible infectious and noninfectious issues, the patient remained intermittently febrile. When a marked peripheral eosinophilia was noted, the patient's levetiracetam was discontinued and phenytoin prescribed. The fever resolved within 24Â hours, and the patient's eosinophilia count returned to normal limits following discharge back to his long-term care facility. We estimate the probability of this reaction related to levetiracetam as probable based on a score of 7 on the Naranjo scale. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility that levetiracetam may be an offending agent in a patient with unexplained fever and eosinophilia. These may be early signs of the progression to a more serious drug hypersensitivity reaction, such as drug rash, eosinophilia, and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome.We have investigated the clinical feasibility of the major urinary metabolite of prostaglandin (PG) E2, tetranor-PGEM, as a biomarker of inflammation in infants with fever. We tested two different and clinically relevant sampling methods, using self-adhesive urinary bags or gauze pads, with respect to stability of tetranor-PGEM and ease of sampling from infants. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis was used to quantify tetranor-PGEM in urine, and different normalization parameters, i.e., urinary creatinine and body surface area, were investigated. To study inflammation, infants (1 month-1 year) that were hospitalized with fever of unknown origin at admittance (n=14) were compared to age-matched healthy controls (n=14). Levels of urinary tetranor-PGEM in infants with viral induced fever were increased compared to controls (102.4Â±56.2 vs. 37.0Â±21.6pmol/ml/m(2) body surface area, p<0.001). We conclude that urinary tetranor-PGEM is a potential non-invasive biomarker of inflammation in infants.Fever is a cardinal response to infection that has been conserved in warm-blooded and cold-blooded vertebrates for more than 600 million years of evolution. The fever response is executed by integrated physiological and neuronal circuitry and confers a survival benefit during infection. In this Review, we discuss our current understanding of how the inflammatory cues delivered by the thermal element of fever stimulate innate and adaptive immune responses. We further highlight the unexpected multiplicity of roles of the pyrogenic cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), both during fever induction and during the mobilization of lymphocytes to the lymphoid organs that are the staging ground for immune defence. We also discuss the emerging evidence suggesting that the adrenergic signalling pathways associated with thermogenesis shape immune cell function.Influenza virus infection-induced inflammatory responses are associated with fever and other symptoms. Although macrolide antibiotics (macrolides) provide anti-inflammatory effects, these effects have not been well studied in influenza patients. We examined the effects of clarithromycin on influenza symptoms. A randomized, prospective, and open-label study was performed between December 2010 and March 2011 and between December 2012 and March 2013 in patients with pandemic A/H1 2009 influenza or seasonal influenza virus infections. Patients aged >15 years received either neuraminidase inhibitors (control group) or clarithromycin plus neuraminidase inhibitors (clarithromycin group). Body temperature and other symptoms were recorded for 5 days after initiating treatment. Serum interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 levels were also measured. Herein, 79 patients were enrolled over the two influenza seasons, and data from 63 patients were analyzed. All patients showed fever and other symptoms, including rhinorrhea (n=38), cough (n=50), sore throat (n=39), arthralgia or myalgia (n=46), and general malaise (n=50). Fever duration was approximately 42% shorter in patients with temperatures â¥38.5Â°C (p=0.02), decreasing from 42 h to 24 h. Among patients with pandemic influenza infections (n=20), the rhinorrhea improvement rate was higher in the clarithromycin group (p=0.03; 88% vs. 20%). Serum IL-6 levels decreased 5 days after treatment, but no differences between the two groups were detected. Clarithromycin may have the additional clinical benefit of improving fever, the main symptom of influenza, in patients treated with neuraminidase inhibitors.There are no specific recommendations for the design and reporting of studies of children with fever and neutropenia (FN). As a result, there is marked heterogeneity in the variables and outcomes that are reported and new definitions continue to emerge. These inconsistencies hinder the ability of researchers and clinicians to compare, contrast and combine results. The objective was to achieve expert consensus on a core set of variables and outcomes that should be measured and reported, as a minimum, in pediatric FN studies. The Delphi method was used to achieve consensus among an international group of clinicians, pharmacists, researchers, and patient representatives. Four surveys focusing on (i) the identification of a core set of variables and outcomes; and (ii) definitions of these variables and outcomes, were administered electronically. Consensus was predefined as more than 80% agreement on any statement. There were forty-five survey participants and the response rate ranged between 84 and 96%. There was consensus on eight core variables and 10 core outcomes that should be collected and reported in all studies of children with FN. Consensus definitions were identified for all of the core outcomes. Using the Delphi method, expert consensus on a set of core variables and outcomes, and their corresponding definitions, was achieved. These core sets represent the minimum that should be collected and reported in all studies of children with FN. This will promote collaboration and ensure consistency and comparability between studies.With new multidrug-resistant microbes and the paucity of new antibacterial agents, we must identify opportunities to safely minimize antibiotics. Current guidelines encourage empiric antibiotics in febrile patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia to reduce infection-related mortalities. No guidelines exist for children with isolated fever at presentation/diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and before starting chemotherapy. This study evaluates the incidence of bacteremia in this subpopulation. We retrospectively analyzed medical records of 230 consecutive patients under 21 years of age diagnosed with ALL at Children's Hospital & Research Center Oakland (CHRCO) from January 2003 through October 2013. We focused on blood cultures obtained within 24 hours of presentation to CHRCO, which was before general anesthesia for a procedure or systemic chemotherapy. Among 221 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 126 (57%) were febrile and had blood cultures obtained. Two patients (1.6%) had positive blood cultures consistent with bacteremia; 1 had group A Î²-hemolytic streptococcus and the other had Escherichia coli. Given the rarity of bacteremia in this subpopulation at our institution, we recommend more judicious use of antibiotics in children with isolated fever at time of ALL diagnosis. We encourage other institutions to conduct similar investigations.Fever in children is a very common symptom associated most of the time with a viral infection. However, in 7% of children, fever without source is the first symptom of a serious bacterial infection such as pneumonia, meningitis, pyelonephritis or bacteremia. The key point in clinical examination of these children is the early identification of toxic signs. Because SBI prevalence is higher in very young children (1-3 month-aged), they required a specific management with some systematic complementary investigations and a broad indication of probabilistic antibiotherapy treatment.Fever in children is a common presentation to the emergency department and in most instances has no adverse consequences. The role of the triage nurse is to have thorough knowledge of up to date practices in caring for the child with fever, and to accurately assess and manage the child. Using evidence based practice to apply appropriate triage categories, effective care including accurate and informed education of parents. Every nurse working on triage should maintain current knowledge and have continuous education concerning the child with fever and the unwell child to promote best patient outcomes and maintain best practice standards.Fever and neutropenia (FN) is a common complication of pediatric cancer treatment, but hospital utilization patterns for this condition are not well described. Data were analyzed from the Kids' Inpatient Database (KID), an all-payer US hospital database, for 2009. Pediatric FN patients were identified using: age â¤19 years, urgent or emergent admit type, non-transferred, and a combination of ICD-9-CM codes for fever and neutropenia. Sampling weights were used to permit national inferences. Pediatric cancer patients accounted for 1.5 % of pediatric hospital discharges in 2009 (n = 110,967), with 10.1 % of cancer-related discharges meeting FN criteria (n = 11,261). Two-fifths of FN discharges had a \"short length of stay\" (SLOS) of â¤3 days, which accounted for approximately $65.5 million in hospital charges. Upper respiratory infection (6.0 %) and acute otitis media (AOM) (3.7 %) were the most common infections associated with SLOS. Factors significantly associated with SLOS included living in the Midwest region (OR = 1.65, 1.22-2.24) or West region (OR 1.54, 1.11-2.14) versus Northeast, having a diagnosis of AOM (OR = 1.39, 1.03-1.87) or viral infection (OR = 1.63, 1.18-2.25) versus those without those comorbidities, and having a soft tissue sarcoma (OR = 1.47, 1.05-2.04), Hodgkin lymphoma (OR = 2.33, 1.62-3.35), or an ovarian/testicular tumor (OR = 1.76, 1.05-2.95) compared with patients without these diagnoses. FN represents a common precipitant for hospitalizations among pediatric cancer patients. SLOS admissions are rarely associated with serious infections, but contribute substantially to the burden of hospitalization for pediatric FN.Fever is a common presenting complaint among adult or pediatric patients in the emergency department setting. Although fever in healthy individuals does not necessarily indicate severe illness, fever in patients with neutropenia may herald a life-threatening infection. Therefore, prompt recognition of patients with neutropenic fever is imperative. Serious bacterial illness is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for neutropenic patients. Neutropenic fever should trigger the initiation of a rapid work-up and the administration of empiric systemic antibiotic therapy to attenuate or avoid the progression along the spectrum of sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock syndrome, and death.The aim of this study was to compare caregivers' knowledge and management of fever in an Italian Pediatric Emergency Department and to determine whether caregivers of a single child or those whose child had a history of chronic illness report greater symptoms of \"fever phobia\". A questionnaire was used to survey caregivers of children who visited pediatric emergency department. of the Milano-Bicocca University Medical Center at San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy. The study was carried out in winter, from December 2012 to January 2013. A total of 98 responses were analyzed. Italian caregivers measure fever at longer intervals and fewer of them wake their children to administer antipyretics. Forty-five percent of caregivers either do not give evidence-based treatment, or do administer drugs more frequently than recommended. No differences emerge between caregivers of a single child or multiple children. Caregivers in the chronic illness group do consider lower temperatures to possibly cause complications, although they state they are less concerned about possible complications resulting from it. Furthermore this subgroup tends to use pediatric emergency units more frequently. Caregivers aggressively administer antipyretics or take the child to the Pediatric Emergency Department in case of fever. Having an only child is not clearly associated with fever phobia. History of chronic illness calls for consideration in further studies to explore it as a trigger factor to fever phobia.Scrub typhus usually presents as acute undifferentiated fever. This cross-sectional study included adult patients presenting with acute undifferentiated fever defined as any febrile illness for â¤ 14 days without evidence of localized infection. Scrub typhus cases were defined by an antibody titer of a â¥ fourfold increase in paired sera, a â¥ 1:160 in a single serum using indirect immunofluorescence assay, or a positive result of the immunochromatographic test. Multiple regression analysis identified predictors associated with scrub typhus to develop a prediction rule. Of 250 cases with known etiology of acute undifferentiated fever, influenza (28.0%), hepatitis A (25.2%), and scrub typhus (16.4%) were major causes. A prediction rule for identifying suspected cases of scrub typhus consisted of age â¥ 65 years (two points), recent fieldwork/outdoor activities (one point), onset of illness during an outbreak period (two points), myalgia (one point), and eschar (two points). The c statistic was 0.977 (95% confidence interval = 0.960-0.994). At a cutoff value â¥ 4, the sensitivity and specificity were 92.7% (79.0-98.1%) and 90.9% (86.0-94.3%), respectively. Scrub typhus, the third leading cause of acute undifferentiated fever in our region, can be identified early using the prediction rule.The most common symptom for which the patients are admitted in our hospitals is fever. This study was carried out to know the causes of fever based on clinical and laboratory findings. In this cross sectional study, 865 consecutive male patients with fever of 100 F and above were included in the study conducted from January 2010 to April 2012. All the patients were male having age between 17 years and 45 years. Out of the 865 patients, 507 (58.61%) came out to be malarial parasite slide positive, 186 (21.50%) patients were malarial parasite slide negative but were having clinical picture of malaria and*responded to anti-malarial treatment, 73 (8.44%) patients were of respiratory tract infections, 21 (2.43%) patients were having gastro enteritis, 20 (2.31%) were diagnosed as cases of typhoid fever, 17 (1.97%) were having urinary tract infections, 24 (2.77%) patients were referred to medical specialist and the rest 1-7 (1.97%) were grouped as others. The most common cause of fever in our study was malaria. Respiratory tract infections are the second most common cause.To compare the intervention effects of four traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) with typical cold or hot property on body temperature and temperature-sensitive transient receptor potential ion channel proteins (TRPs) of rats with yeast-induced fever. The pyrexia model was induced by injecting yeast suspension subcutaneously. Totally 108 male SD rats were randomly divided into the normal group, the model group, the Rhei Radix et Rhizoma treated group, the Coptidis Rhizoma treated group, the Euodiae Fructus treated group, and the Alpiniae Officinarum Rhizoma treated group, with 18 rats in each group. At the 4 h, 8 h and 12 h after injection of yeast, the rats were sacrificed to collect their hypothalamus and dorsal root ganglion. The expressions of TRPV1 and TRPM8 were detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot method. Compared with the normal group, after injection of yeast, the temperature of rats in the model group notably increased, and reached the peak at 8 h (P < 0.01). The TRPV1 level in hypothalamus and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of the model group significantly increased, whereas the TRPM8 level significantly reduced. Compared with the model group, the Rhei Radix et Rhizoma group and the Coptidis Rhizoma group showed significant decrease in the high body temperature of rats caused by yeast, down-regulation in the expression of TRPV1, and up-regulation in the expression of TRPM8 (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Euodiae Fructus and Alpiniae Officinarum Rhizoma had no significant effect on either temperature or TRPs of fever rats. Rhei Radix et Rhizoma and Coptidis Rhizoma, both are TCMs with cold property, can reduce the temperature of fever rats induced by yeast, which may be related to their effective regulation of TRPV1 and TRPM8 in hypothalamus and DRG, while Euodiae Fructus and Alpiniae Officinarum Rhizoma had no relevant effect.Periodic Fever, Aphtous stomatitis, Pharyngitis, and Adenitis (PFAPA) is a childhood febrile syndrome that is often cured by tonsillectomy (TE). We hypothesized that microbes present in the tonsils may act as a trigger for the activation of inflammasomes and investigated the microbiology of the tonsils in PFAPA patients and controls. We recruited 31 consecutive children who underwent TE due to PFAPA; 24 children who underwent TE due to other reasons served as controls. We cultured all the samples for bacteria, mycobacteria, yeasts, and viruses and used PCR for 15 viruses. Also biofilm formation and histologic findings were identified. The samples of the patients yielded Candida albicans more often than did the controls (16 vs 0%, p = 0.003). Staphylococcus aureus occurred in only 10% of the patients, but in 38% of the controls (p = 0.01). Varicella zoster and Herpes simplex viruses occurred less often in patients than in controls. Biofilm was present in 55% of PFAPA tonsils, but in only 24% of the controls (p = 0.03). The microbes found in the tonsils of PFAPA patients showed significant differences from those of controls. This may in part explain the efficacy of TE in PFAPA.Fever in children is frequent. Often mild, initial care is the parents' responsibility: medicinal treatments and medical consultations. Unfortunately, the efficiency of parental care is poor. Therefore, in 2005Â the AFSSAPS updated its recommendations. One and 6Â years after publication of the guidelines, this study rates their impact by describing and comparing parents' knowledge and behavior when faced with fever in their children. This survey was conducted in families whose children were attending preschool in and near Metz (France) in 2006Â and 2012. The same questionnaire was given to assess the knowledge, care, and symptoms of serious fever. The results were processed based on the number of children in the family and the family's socioeconomic category. In 2006, 1038Â questionnaires were distributed and 1273Â in 2012. The fever threshold was not better known in 2012. Bathing and uncovering children remained the predominant physical methods used. Treatment was based on the use of ibuprofen and alternating treatments. However, the conditions of administering medication were well known to parents. The causes and motives for consultation were not better understood in 2012Â however. The main source of information was physicians. The message disseminated since 2005Â has not been efficient. Its complexity has not eradicated old beliefs and inappropriate parental practices. A campaign based on a brief, simple message has to be organized, providing better chances of being assimilated by the public. Medical practices should be standardized.Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an enzyme that catalyzes degradation of the heme and regulates its availability for newly synthetized hemeproteins such as cyclooxygenases, NO synthases and cytochrome P450. Moreover, HO-1 activity modulates synthesis of cytokines and prostaglandins. All of these factors are well-defined components of fever and pyrogenic tolerance mechanisms. We examine the effect of HO-1 induction and activation using cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP) on changes in body temperature (Tb), plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), prostaglandin Eâ (PGEâ) and HO-1 protein in the course of these processes. Intraperitoneally (i.p.) pre-treatment of rats with CoPP (5 mg kg(-1)) significantly accelerated and enhanced the early stage of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced fever and shortened a post-fever recovery to normal temperature. Pre-treatment with CoPP significantly potentiated the increase in plasma IL-6, PGEâ and HO-1 levels measured 4h after the LPS administration. Furthermore, induction of HO-1 attenuated the development of pyrogenic tolerance to repeated injections of LPS. Based on these data we conclude that heme oxygenase-1 may act as a physiological regulator of the febrile response intensity to bacterial infections.Sepsis is the most common cause of mortality in sickle cell disease (SCD). Empiric antibiotic administration after obtaining blood cultures in febrile children with SCD has been a standard practice parameter. Our primary objective was to calculate the rate of bacteremia in febrile pediatric patients with SCD. Our secondary objective was to establish whether vital signs or diagnostics predict bacteremia in these patients. We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients with SCD who presented to an urban pediatric emergency department in Newark, NJ between January 1, 2001 and June 30, 2011 with the chief complaint of fever. Patients between the ages of 0 and 20 years with SCD who presented with the chief complaint of fever and who had a blood culture performed were included. Descriptive data, visit-specific data, and diagnostic data were collected. Charts of 307 patients were included. Six patients had a positive blood culture, one of which was considered a true pathogen (Streptococcus pneumoniae) (0.33%; 95% confidence interval 0.06%-1.86%). There was no statistical significance between the means of visit-specific and diagnostic data of patients with positive blood cultures and those with negative blood cultures. The incidence of bacteremia in febrile children with SCD presenting to the emergency department is low. Close follow-up within 24 hours and delayed antibiotic administration can be a plausible alternative treatment option in this population.Recurrent fever often occurs during the treatment of bacterial meningitis in children. Few studies have focused on the difference between the patients with and without recurrent fever. The pathogenesis and clinical significance of recurrent fever remain to be elucidated. The objectives of this study were to clarify the clinical features of the patients with recurrent fever, and to identify the predictive factors for recurrent fever in childhood bacterial meningitis. We conducted a hospital-based retrospective chart review and confirmed 52 cases of bacterial meningitis. Recurrent fever was observed in 27 of 52 (52%) patients overall, and 27 of 47 (57%) patients with dexamethasone (DEX) therapy. All patients with recurrent fever received DEX therapy. The mean date of recurrent fever occurrence was 6.2 +/- 2.0 days after admission. The median duration of recurrent fever was 5 days (range 1-19 days). The proportion of patients < 2 years of age was higher in patients with recurrent fever than those without recurrent fever (p = 0.041). Initial peripheral white blood cell count was lower in patients with recurrent fever (p = 0.008). Of the 52 children, 10 (19%) showed neurological sequelae. Neurological sequelae were more frequent in patients with recurrent fever than those without recurrent fever, although this was not statistically significant (p = 0.078). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the most powerful predictive factor for recurrent fever in patients with DEX therapy was young age (< 2 years) (adjusted odds ratio, 5.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-20.7). These results suggest that recurrent fever is related to the two known factors for sequelae, low peripheral white blood cell count and young age. Recurrent fever should be recognized as a possible risk factor for neurological sequelae.To investigate clinical presentation, genetic background and cytokine profile of Japanese sporadic cases of periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome. Nine PFAPA syndrome patients were recruited. DNA sequence analysis of auto inflammatory disorder susceptibility genes, MEFV, MVK, NLRP3, and TNFRSF1A, were performed. Serum cytokine levels and monocyte IL-1Î² levels were measured by ELISA. The study population consisted of six males and three females (mean age of onset 26.8Â months). Febrile episodes lasted 3-6Â days with symptom-free intervals ranging from 2 to 12Â weeks. Fever was accompanied by pharyngitis (nâ=â8), aphthous stomatitis (nâ=â4), and cervical adenitis (nâ=â5). White blood cells and C-reactive protein were increased during the attack phase. Mean IgD serum levels were 7.32âÂ±â9.51Â mg/dl during the attack phase, and were mildly elevated in two patients. Heterozygous MEFV, NLRP3 and TNFRSF1A variants were detected in four, one and three cases, respectively. Serum TNF-Î± and IL-18 levels were elevated during the attack-free and attack periods compared with controls. Other cytokines, IL-1Î², IL-1ra, IL-6, and sTNFR1, were only increased during the attack phase. Oral prednisolone was administered to eight patients and immediately reduced fever. Tonsillectomy performed in five patients induced cessation of fever in four patients. One case with repeated fever attacks after tonsillectomy showed increased monocyte IL-1Î² production, similar to the other active case with genetic variants of auto inflammatory disorder-associated genes. Japanese PFAPA syndrome patients may have cytokine regulation dysfunction as a result of genetic variants of auto inflammatory disorder-associated genes.Although peripherally released interleukin (IL)-10 has a critical regulatory role in limiting fever in mild-to-moderate forms of inflammation, its role in regulating the more complex thermoregulatory manifestations of hypothermia and fever noted during severe inflammation is less clear. Using cytokine antagonism, we therefore investigated the involvement of peripherally released IL-10 in mediating hypothermia, fever and inflammation induced by intraperitoneal (IP) administration of a large dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Male Wistar rats (200-250 g) were anaesthetized and implanted intra-abdominally with temperature-sensitive radiotelemeters. Rats were randomly assigned to receive IL-10 antiserum (IL-10AS) or normal sheep serum IP, 4 h before receiving an IP injection of LPS (10 mg/kg) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Inflammatory responses were measured in plasma and tissue samples (spleen, liver and brain) at 90 min and 6 h after the IP injection of LPS or PBS. Administration of LPS induced an initial period of hypothermia (~90 min) after which fever developed. Pre-treating rats with IL-10AS abolished the LPS-induced increase in plasma IL-10 levels, attenuated the hypothermia and increased the amplitude of the fever. Moreover, IL-10AS pre-treatment augmented the LPS-induced increase in plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (90 min and 6 h), IL-1Î² (90 min), prostaglandin E2 (90 min) and IL-6 (6 h), in the periphery, but not the hypothalamus, over the duration of hypothermia and fever. Via its action on the synthesis of inflammatory mediators in the spleen and liver, endogenous IL-10 plays a crucial regulatory role in mediating hypothermia and fever during severe aspectic (LPS-induced) systemic inflammation.To determine predictors of serious bacterial infections in pediatric burn patients with fever (core temp â¥38.5Â°C), the authors conducted a retrospective review of medical records of pediatric (0-18 years) patients admitted to the Arizona Burn Center between 2008 and 2011 with greater than 5% TBSA and inpatient hospitalization for â¥72 hours. The study group comprised patients with a febrile episode during their inpatient stay. Serious bacterial infection (the primary outcome variable) was defined as: bacteremia, urinary tract infection, meningitis (blood, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid culture positive for a pathogen respectively), pneumonia, line, and wound infection. A generalized estimating equation analysis was done to predict the presence or absence of serious bacterial infection. Of 1082 pediatric burn patients hospitalized during the study period, 353 met the study eligibility criteria. A total of 108 patients (30.6%) had at least one fever episode (fever group). No difference in demographic characteristics was noted between the fever and no-fever groups; significant differences were observed for: third-degree TBSA, second-degree TBSA, total operating room visits, length of stay, Injury Severity Score, and death. A total of 47.2% of the patients had one or more episodes of fever with serious bacterial infection. In a generalized estimating equation predictive model, presence of a central line, second-, and third-degree TBSA were predictive of serious bacterial infection in burn patients with fever. In this study, individual clinical variables such as tachypnea and tachycardia were not predictive of serious bacterial infections, but the presence of a central line, and larger TBSA were significant predictors of serious bacterial infections. Younger age (P =.08) and ventilator support (P =.057) also approached significance as predictors of serious bacterial infections.There have been few reports describing antibiotic related fever especially in the beta-lactam class of antibiotics. The present report is a case of postoperative immediate-onset cefazolin-related fever in a lumbar spine surgery patient. A 58-year-old woman presented with progressive low back pain and neurogenic claudication of both extremities for six months. Magnetic resonance imagese (MRI) of the lumbar spine indicated central canal stenosis with nerve root compression from L4 to S1. After decompressive laminectomy, pedicular screw fixation, and posterolateral fusion were performed, the patient experienced-postoperative fever without obvious evidence of infection. The blood and tip of drain bacterial culture grew no organisms. After propholactic cefazolin was discontinued in postoperative day 5, the fever began to declined and returned to normal on postoperative day 9. Postoperative drug fever that is caused by prophylactic cefazolin may be delayed in diagnosis because drug fever is usually diagnosed by exclusion after the elimination of other potential causes. The research authors would like to encourage physicians to be aware of this entity. Prompt cause identification can obviate unnecessary diagnostic procedures and inappropriate treatments.To examine the impact of providing rapid diagnostic tests for malaria on fever management in private drug retail shops where most poor rural people with fever present, with the aim of reducing current massive overdiagnosis and overtreatment of malaria. Cluster randomized trial of 24 clusters of shops. Dangme West, a poor rural district of Ghana. Shops and their clients, both adults and children. Providing rapid diagnostic tests with realistic training. The primary outcome was the proportion of clients testing negative for malaria by a double-read research blood slide who received an artemisinin combination therapy or other antimalarial. Secondary outcomes were use of antibiotics and antipyretics, and safety. Of 4603 clients, 3424 (74.4%) tested negative by double-read research slides. The proportion of slide-negative clients who received any antimalarial was 590/1854 (32%) in the intervention arm and 1378/1570 (88%) in the control arm (adjusted risk ratio 0.41 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.58), P<0.0001). Treatment was in high agreement with rapid diagnostic test result. Of those who were slide-positive, 690/787 (87.8%) in the intervention arm and 347/392 (88.5%) in the control arm received an artemisinin combination therapy (adjusted risk ratio 0.96 (0.84 to 1.09)). There was no evidence of antibiotics being substituted for antimalarials. Overall, 1954/2641 (74%) clients in the intervention arm and 539/1962 (27%) in the control arm received appropriate treatment (adjusted risk ratio 2.39 (1.69 to 3.39), P<0.0001). No safety concerns were identified. Most patients with fever in Africa present to the private sector. In this trial, providing rapid diagnostic tests for malaria in the private drug retail sector significantly reduced dispensing of antimalarials to patients without malaria, did not reduce prescribing of antimalarials to true malaria cases, and appeared safe. Rapid diagnostic tests should be considered for the informal private drug retail sector.Registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01907672.What is the central question of this study? Do plasma concentrations of oestrogen and progesterone similar to those observed near the term of pregnancy alter basal core temperature or the core temperature response to bacterial pyrogen in oophorectomized rats? What is the main finding and its importance? Plasma concentrations of oestrogen and progesterone similar to those observed near the term of pregnancy do not alter basal core temperature or the overall febrile response to bacterial pyrogen in oophorectomized rats. Thus, our data do not support the hypothesis that sex steroids mediate the regulated decrease in basal core temperature or the attenuated/absent core temperature response to bacterial pyrogen observed in rats near the term of pregnancy. Fever, an important component of the host's defence response to infection, is absent or attenuated in rats near the term of pregnancy concurrent with major changes in blood concentrations of the sex steroids, oestrogen and progesterone. The present experiments were carried out to determine the potential role of oestrogen and progesterone in mediating the altered core temperature response to bacterial pyrogen. For the experiments, oestrogen and progesterone were administered alone or in combination to oophorectomized, non-pregnant rats in concentrations that mimicked plasma levels of these hormones measured in pregnant rats on days 17, 18, 19 and 20 of gestation. Treatment with oestrogen or progesterone alone or in combination did not alter basal core temperature or the overall febrile response (i.e. 12Â h fever index) to an EC50 dose of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (i.e. 20Â Î¼gÂ kg(-1) ). Administration of oestrogen did, however, influence the early core temperature response and increase the latency to fever following administration of lipopolysaccharide. Thus, our data provide evidence that although oestrogen may influence the early core temperature response to lipopolysaccharide, sex steroids in concentrations similar to those observed late in gestation do not alter the overall febrile response and are therefore unlikely to mediate the attenuated or absent febrile response to bacterial pyrogen in rats near the term of pregnancy.Fever predicts clinical outcomes in sepsis, trauma and during cardiovascular stress, yet the genetic determinants are poorly understood. We used an integrative genomics approach to identify novel genomic determinants of the febrile response to experimental endotoxemia. We highlight multiple integrated lines of evidence establishing the clinical relevance of this novel fever locus. Through genome-wide association study (GWAS) of evoked endotoxemia (lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1 ng/kg IV) in healthy subjects of European ancestry we discovered a locus on chr7p11.2 significantly associated with the peak febrile response to LPS (top single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7805622, P = 2.4 Ã 10(-12)), as well as with temperature fluctuation over time. We replicated this association in a smaller independent LPS study (rs7805622, P = 0.03). In clinical translation, this locus was also associated with temperature and mortality in critically ill patients with trauma or severe sepsis. The top GWAS SNPs are not located within protein-coding genes, but have significant cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) associations with expression of a cluster of genes â¼400 kb upstream, several of which (SUMF2, CCT6A, GBAS) are regulated by LPS in vivo in blood cells. LPS- and cold-treatment of adipose stromal cells in vitro suggest genotype-specific modulation of eQTL candidate genes (PSPH). Several eQTL genes were up-regulated in brown and white adipose following cold exposure in mice, highlighting a potential role in thermogenesis. Thus, through genomic interrogation of experimental endotoxemia, we identified and replicated a novel fever locus on chr7p11.2 that modulates clinical responses in trauma and sepsis, and highlight integrated in vivo and in vitro evidence for possible novel cis candidate genes conserved across human and mouse.To find the underlying diagnoses of patients admitted to a medical department with symptoms of fever to ascertain whether the duration of fever, temperature readings, and common laboratory tests could give a clue to the final diagnosis. A retrospective study of the records of 299 patients admitted to the Medical Department, Haukeland University Hospital from July 1st, 2001 until June 30th, 2004 for fever without any diagnosis suggesting the cause of the fever. Infections were the most common diagnoses, but the proportion of patients with infections declined with increasing duration of fever before admission (63.7 % when <7 days, 45.8 % when >21 days). A group of patients on immunosuppressive therapy were all hospitalized within 1 week from the debut of fever, and their causes of fever were comparable to those of non-immunocompromised patients with fever of the same duration. With fever <7 days, patients with bacterial or viral infection had higher maximum temperatures (medians 39.2 and 38.9 Â°C, respectively) than those without infection (median 38.0 Â°C). Patients with bacterial infection had higher C-reactive protein (CRP) levels than patients in the other groups, whereas viral infection was associated with higher lymphocyte counts. The neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio was higher in patients with fever due to bacterial infections than in those with viral infections. For patients with fever for <1 week, neutrophil [area under the curve (AUC) 0.723], white blood cell (WBC, AUC 0.692), and monocyte (AUC 0.691) counts and CRP levels (AUC 0.684) were the best single indicators of bacterial infection.The periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and cervical adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome is an autoinflammatory disease characterized by regularly recurrent fever episodes due to seemingly unprovoked inflammation. To assess serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations in children with PFAPA syndrome and evaluate longitudinally the effect of wintertime vitamin D supplementation on the disease course. We have evaluated 25 Italian patients (19 males, 6 females, aged 2.4-5.3 years), fulfilling the Euro-Fever PFAPA criteria. For each patient, we recorded demographic and anthropometric data, clinical manifestations, serum calcium, phosphate, and 25(OH)D. After 400 IU vitamin D supplementation during wintertime, clinical and auxological characteristics, calcium, phosphate, and 25(OH)D levels were re-evaluated. Data were compared with a sex- and age-matched control group. PFAPA patients showed reduced 25(OH)D levels than controls (p<0.0001). Regarding the effect of seasons on vitamin D, winter 25(OH)D levels were significantly reduced than summer ones (p<0.005). Moreover, these levels were significantly lower than in healthy controls (p<0.005), and correlated with both fever episodes (p<0.005) and C-reactive protein values (p<0.005). After vitamin D supplementation, PFAPA patients showed a significantly decreased number of febrile episodes and modification of their characteristics (mean duration of fever episodes, p<0.05; number of febrile episodes per year p<0.005). Deficient and insufficient vitamin D serum levels were found in most children with PFAPA syndrome, and hypovitaminosis D might be a significant risk factor for PFAPA flares. However, vitamin D supplementation seems to significantly reduce the typical PFAPA episodes and their duration, supporting the role of vitamin D as an immune-regulatory factor in this syndrome.Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a tick-borne acute infectious disease caused by the SFTS virus (SFTSV). SFTS has been reported in China, South Korea, and Japan as a novel Bunyavirus. Although several molecular epidemiology and phylogenetic studies have been performed, the information obtained was limited, because the analyses included no or only a small number of SFTSV strains from Japan. The nucleotide sequences of 75 SFTSV samples in Japan were newly determined directly from the patients' serum samples. In addition, the sequences of 7 strains isolated in vitro were determined and compared with those in the patients' serum samples. More than 90 strains that were identified in China, 1 strain in South Korea, and 50 strains in Japan were phylogenetically analyzed. The viruses were clustered into 2 clades, which were consistent with the geographic distribution. Three strains identified in Japan were clustered in the Chinese clade, and 4 strains identified in China and 26 in South Korea were clustered in the Japanese clade. Two clades of SFTSV may have evolved separately over time. On rare occasions, the viruses were transmitted overseas to the region in which viruses of the other clade were prevalent.The present study has evaluated the protection conferred by a single subcutaneous dose of a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vectored vaccine encoding the Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) glycoproteins Gn and Gc in lambs. Three groups of six to seven lambs were immunized as follows: one group received the vaccine (termed rMVA-GnGc), a second group received an MVA vector (vector control) and a third group received saline solution (non-vaccinated control). Fourteen days later, all animals were subcutaneously challenged with 10(5) TCID50 of the virulent RVFV isolate 56/74 and vaccine efficacy assessed using standard endpoints. Two lambs (one from the vaccine group and one from the vector control group) succumbed to RVFV challenge, showing characteristic liver lesions. Lambs from both the vector control and non-vaccinated groups were febrile from days 2 to 5 post challenge (pc) while those in the rMVA-GnGc group showed a single peak of pyrexia at day 3 pc. RVFV RNA was detected in both nasal and oral swabs from days 3 to 7 pc in some lambs from the vector control and non-vaccinated groups, but no viral shedding could be detected in the surviving lambs vaccinated with rMVA-GnGc. Together, the data suggest that a single dose of the rMVA-GnGc vaccine may be sufficient to reduce RVFV shedding and duration of viremia but does not provide sterile immunity nor protection from disease. Further optimization of this vaccine approach in lambs is warranted.Various retinal manifestations can occur following a febrile illness due to viral, bacterial or protozoal etiology. As there are limited data in the literature, we undertook this study to analyse the clinical presentation of post-fever retinitis due to various etiologies, as well as its course and management. This was a retrospective study of 14 consecutive cases who presented to the Vitreo Retina Department of our hospital over a 1-year period between January 2010 and December 2010. All patients underwent detailed ophthalmic examination and relevant investigations including fundus fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Basic and specific investigations were performed as necessary. All patients were given systemic steroids which were tapered based on clinical response. Twenty-one eyes of 14 patients (7 bilateral, 7 unilateral) were studied. Onset of ocular symptoms was approximately 3 weeks after fever. Four patients had specific etiology-one each of chikungunya, enteric fever, malaria and abdominal abscess with pneumococcal pneumonia. The presenting visual acuity of the affected eyes averaged 2/60. Six eyes had relative afferent pupillary defect. All patients had solitary or multiple patches of retinitis at the posterior pole and exudation at the macula. OCT through the lesions revealed inner retinal hyperreflectivity and thickening with after-shadowing. All patients showed improvement in vision with unilateral cases improving to an average of 6/12 and bilateral cases improving to an average of 6/24. Patients also showed resolution of retinitis, macular edema and serous detachment. Post-fever retinitis as a condition manifested approximately 3 weeks after onset of fever. Irrespective of the cause of the fever, clinical presentation of cases was similar with inner retinitis at the posterior pole and a favourable response to steroids, suggesting a possible immunological basis for this condition.Periodic fever syndromes (PFS) are an emerging group of autoinflammatory disorders. Clinical overlap exists and multiple genetic analyses may be needed to assist diagnosis. We evaluated the diagnostic value of a 5-gene sequencing panel (5GP) in patients with undiagnosed PFS. Simultaneous double strand Sanger sequencing of MEFV, MVK, TNFRSF1A, NLRP3, NLRP12 genes was performed in 42 patients with unexplained PFS. Clinical features were correlated with genetic results. None of 42 patients analyzed displayed a causative genotype. However, single or multiple genetic variants of uncertain significance were detected in 24 subjects. Only in 5 subjects a definite diagnosis was made by taking into account both genetic and clinical data (2 TRAPS syndrome; 2 FMF; 1 FCAS). Statistical analysis showed that patients carrying genetic variants in one or more of the five selected genes displayed a significantly lower response to glucocorticoids compared with subjects who had completely negative genetic results. The sequencing of multiple genes is of little help in the diagnostics of PFS and can often lead to results of uncertain interpretation, thus the clinically driven sequencing of single genes should remain the recommended approach. However, the presence of single or multiple genetic variants of uncertain significance, even if not allowing any specific diagnosis, correlated with a poorer response to glucocorticoids, possibly indicating a multifactorial subgroup of PFS with differential response to pharmacological treatment.Infrared thermography systems have been used for fever screening at many airports since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. However, many of these systems are expensive and non-portable. Therefore, we developed a cost-effective and compact (2.9 Ã 5.8 Ã 2.0 cm) thermopile array for fever screening of patients with infectious diseases in the clinical setting. The array was created with small pixels (48 Ã 47 = 2256 pixels) fabricated on a silicon wafer using microelectromechanical systems technology. We tested this array on 155 febrile and afebrile patients (35.4Â°C â¤ axillary temperature â¤ 39.3Â°C) with seasonal influenza at the Japan Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital. The maximum facial temperature, measured by the array at 0.3 m from the subject, exhibited a positive correlation with axillary temperature measured using a contact-type thermometer (r = 0.71, p < 0.01). The sensitivity and specificity of the thermopile array in identifying the febrile subjects were 80.5% and 93.3%, respectively, setting the threshold cut-off of maximum facial temperature at an appropriate value. Our cost-effective thermopile array appears promising for future close-range fever screening of patients with infectious diseases at primary care doctor clinics, health care centers, and quarantine stations in developing and developed countries.To summarize the epidemiological characteristics of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) in Zhejiang Province, China. A standardized questionnaire was used to collect information on demographic features, exposure history, clinical symptoms, and timelines of medical visits. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the characteristics of SFTS. A total of 65 cases of SFTS were identified in Zhejiang Province from 2011 to 2013, of whom 34 were male and 31 were female. The median age was 66 years and 60 cases occurred in persons aged â¥ 50 years. The majority (91%) of SFTS cases occurred between May and August. With regard to exposure history, patients had pursued outdoor activities (63%), had a history of exposure to a tick (68%) or tick bite (29%), bred domestic animals (31%), or had a history of exposure to a mouse (57%), and some patients had a multi-exposure history. Approximately 98.46% of patients were hospitalized, and symptoms of the illness included fever (98%), fatigue (71%), chills (51%), etc. Two family clusters occurred, although there was no person-to-person transmission. In Zhejiang Province, SFTS is prevalent between May and August among elderly persons who live in hilly areas, and clinical features are not specific. More emphasis should be given to this disease and further training of medical personnel should be carried out to prevent misdiagnosis.A 53-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for treatment of fever and chest pain. Chest computed tomography showed an anterior mediastinal cystic tumor 39Ã57 mm in size surrounded by fat with edema and left pleural effusion. After one course of antibiotic administration, the edema of fat surrounding the tumor disappeared and the patient underwent scheduled tumor resection with thymectomy through a median sternotomy. Postoperative pathological examination revealed a thymoma of type AB according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification associated with hemorrhage and necrosis. Cases of thymoma with hemorrhage or necrosis may lead to atypical presentations such as fever, acute chest pain, pleural effusion, and spontaneous regression. Clinicians should be aware of these unusual presentations of chest pain and fever due to thymoma, and consider the possibility of a differential diagnosis of an anterior mediastinal tumor.To analyze the epidemiological features and surveillance management programs on severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) in China from 2011 to 2014. The analysis of epidemiological characteristics and surveillance management programs was based on the annual reporting data collected from the National Disease Reporting Information System while the description of cluster incidents was based on those reports collected from the Public Health Emergency Information Management System (PHEIMS). Association between age groups and fatality rate was tested under the Cochran-Armitage Trend Test. The difference of fatality rates between differing groups was analyzed, using the chi-square test, with statistical significance on Î± = 0.05. Between 2011 and 2014, 5 352 suspected, probable and lab-confirmed cases of SFTS were reported in 23 provinces, of which 16 provinces reported 2 750 lab-confirmed cases with a fatality of 7.9%, accounting for 51.4% of all the cases, nation-wide. Henan, Shandong, Hubei, Anhui, Liaoning, Zhejiang and Jiangsu reported 99.3% of those lab-confirmed cases. The period between April and October appeared the epidemic season, with its peak from May to July. Most cases were farmers, accounted for 88.3% of the lab-confirmed cases. People at the age between 50-74 occupied 67.6% of all the cases. Fatality of the disease continually increased from 3.7% in the age group 40-44 to 13.5% in the age group older than 80. Fatality rates appeared statistically different between the groups with or without misdiagnosis, with OR as 3.06 (95% CI: 1.61-5.90). Secondary cases of the cluster incidents were most likely to result from contacting the blood of the index cases. Number of reported SFTS cases showed a rising trend in China. Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Shandong and Liaoning provinces appeared at high risk of the disease. Geographical distribution of the SFTS cases' seemed highly sporadic, with May to July being the peak season. Farmers and elderly were considered as high risk population. Occasionally, cluster incidents might be seen, as the result of contacting the blood of cases or corpses. Being at older age and misdiagnosis seemed to be risk factors for fatality.Fever during pregnancy has been suspected to harm the developing fetus. However, until now, no systematic analysis of the available evidence has been undertaken to assess the impact of maternal fever on health outcomes in the child. The goal of this study was to systematically review evidence from epidemiologic studies on adverse health outcomes of the offspring in relation to exposure to maternal fever during pregnancy. Systematic searches in PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were performed by using Medical Subject Headings, Boolean operators, and truncation, and references of references were reviewed. Cohort and case-control studies addressing health outcomes of prenatal fever exposure in humans were eligible for inclusion. Studies with no direct reference to fever, studies in selected populations (eg, preterm births), and studies published before 1990 were excluded. The available literature supported an increased risk of adverse offspring health in association with fever during pregnancy. The strongest evidence was available for neural tube defects, congenital heart defects, and oral clefts, in which meta-analyses suggested between a 1.5- and nearly 3-fold increased risk with fever exposure in the first trimester. We did not find strong evidence of a dose-response relationship, but there was some evidence that antipyretic medications may have a protective effect when used in relation to febrile episodes. We found substantial evidence to support the contention that maternal fever during pregnancy may negatively affect offspring health. The harmful effects seemed to cover both short- and longer-term health outcomes; however, for several outcomes, the evidence was insufficient to judge any association.Fever can be treated with a higher priority than pain in the pediatric emergency department (ED) population. The primary objective was to assess whether patients with a fever are treated with acetaminophen or ibuprofen more promptly than they are treated for pain. A retrospective descriptive study was performed on all patients between the ages of 3 and 19 years who received acetaminophen or ibuprofen in the pediatric ED from February 1, 2010 to January 31, 2011. The time interval from arrival to treatment with acetaminophen or ibuprofen was compared for those patients with a fever (â¥100.4Â°F) and those without a fever and had reported pain. Other measurable points (time of vital signs, bed assignment, and medication order) on the medical record were compared to further describe any differences. Pediatric patients with fever (n = 1097) received ibuprofen or acetaminophen a median of 54.0 min (interquartile range [IQR], 35.4-89.3 min) after arrival. The corresponding median time for afebrile patients (n = 1861) that received the same medications was 83.2 min (IQR, 52.7-136.1). The difference between medians was 24.6 min (95% confidence interval 21.3-27.9 min). Fever is treated more promptly than pain in the pediatric ED. This difference is associated with prevailing and largely unfounded concerns about fever and the undertreatment of pain (oligoanalgesia).Drug fever (DF) is a febrile reaction induced by a drug without additional clinical features like skin eruption. This adverse drug reaction is probably common but under diagnosed. While its outcome is generally favourable, DF generates unnecessary diagnostic procedures as well as hospitalisations or hospitalisation prolongations. Clinical presentation and biological findings are not specific. Fever is generally well tolerated but may be accompanied by general symptoms mimicking sepsis. Moderate biological disorders could be expected, including elevation or decrease in white blood cell count, eosinophilia, liver cytolysis, and increased C-reactive protein. An infection should be systematically ruled out. Clinical or biological signs of severity should question DF diagnosis. When DF is suspected, the involved drug(s) should be stopped after a reliable assessment of imputability. Antibiotics represent the most often implicated drugs. Fever disappearance after discontinuing the suspected drug is the cornerstone of DF diagnosis. Before stopping the administration of the suspected drug(s), a risk/benefit ratio assessment is necessary. Consistently, it may be complicated to stop an antimicrobial drug when treating an infection or an immunosuppressive drug if required.This study seeks to determine not only the reliability of parental touch in detecting fever as compared to rectal thermometry in under-five children, but also the sociodemographic factors that may predict its reliability. The study was carried out in the Emergency Paediatric Unit of a tertiary hospital in North Central Nigeria. 409 children aged less than 5âyears with a history of fever in the 48âh prior to presentation and their mothers were recruited consecutively. All the children recruited completed the study. Children with clinical parameters suggestive of shock, and those who were too ill, were excluded from the study. The primary outcome was the proportion of mothers who could accurately predict if their child was febrile or not (defined by rectal temperature) using tactile assessment only. Secondary outcomes were the validity and accuracy of touch in detecting fever and factors related to its accuracy. About 85% of the children were febrile using rectal thermometry. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values for touch as a screening tool were 63%, 54%, 88.3% and 21%, respectively. High maternal socioeconomic status and low maternal age influenced positively the accuracy of touch in correctly determining the presence or absence of fever. This study has shown that tactile assessment of temperature is not reliable and that absence of fever in a previously febrile child should be confirmed by objective methods of temperature measurement.The cytokine IL-6, which is released upon peripheral immune challenge, is critical for the febrile response, but the mechanism by which IL-6 is pyrogenic has remained obscure. Here we generated mice with deletion of the membrane bound IL-6 receptor Î± (IL-6RÎ±) on neural cells, on peripheral nerves, on fine sensory afferent fibers, and on brain endothelial cells, respectively, and examined its role for the febrile response to peripherally injected lipopolysaccharide. We show that IL-6RÎ± on neural cells, peripheral nerves, and fine sensory afferents are dispensable for the lipopolysaccharide-induced fever, whereas IL-6RÎ± in the brain endothelium plays an important role. Hence deletion of IL-6RÎ± on brain endothelial cells strongly attenuated the febrile response, and also led to reduced induction of the prostaglandin synthesizing enzyme Cox-2 in the hypothalamus, the temperature-regulating center in the brain, as well as reduced expression of SOCS3, suggesting involvement of the STAT signaling pathway. Furthermore, deletion of STAT3 in the brain endothelium also resulted in attenuated fever. These data show that IL-6, when endogenously released during systemic inflammation, is pyrogenic by binding to IL-6RÎ± on brain endothelial cells to induce prostaglandin synthesis in these cells, probably in concerted action with other peripherally released cytokines.The metal fume fever (MFF) is an inhalation fever syndrome in welders of galvanized steel, who join and cut metal parts using flame or electric arc and other sources of heat. Inhalation of certain freshly formed metal oxides produced from welding process can cause MFF as an acute self-limiting flulike illness. The most common cause of MFF is the inhalation of zinc oxide (ZnO). The inhalation of ZnO particles can provoke a number of clinical responses of which accompanied by changes in composition of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, including early increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines, inflammatory marker, and recruitment of inflammatory cells in the lungs. The MFF is characterized by fever, cough, sputing, wheezing, chest tightness, fatique, chills, fever, myalgias, cough, dyspnea, leukocytosis with a left shift, thirst, metallic taste, and salivations. The diagnosis of MFF diagnosis is based on clinical finding and occupational history. The symptoms resolved spontaneously. The treatment of MFF is entirely symptomatic, no specific treatment is indicated for MFF. The mainstay of management of MFF is prevention of sub-sequent exposure to harmful metals. Including public and physician awareness of MFF may help to reduce the occurrence of the disease.The need to rapidly screen patients during outbreaks has prompted Cutaneous Infrared Thermometry (CIT) use. Little is known of CIT performance in this context. What are the performance characteristics of simple CIT in detecting fever? Prospective cohort, sequential convenience sample. All patients presenting to the study Emergency Department for care. CIT and oral temperature measurements. Fever defined as oral temperatureâ¥38Â°C. CIT is measured simultaneously with oral temperatures. Comparisons of temperatures are expressed as means and 95% confidence intervals. Means are compared using Student's t test. Limits of agreement are measured using Bland-Altman. Receiver operating characteristics are determined. There are 548 cases comprising 224 males, 324 females, with mean age 26 years. The mean temperature difference is 12.95Â°C, (13.18-9.08Â°C) pâ¤0.0001. Bland-Altman demonstrates bias at 8.680 (-9.084 to -8.275) pâ¤0.0001 with upper and lower level bias values of 18.124 (18.819-17.435) and 0.768 (0.076-1.459), respectively. Based on Receiver Operator Characteristics analysis, detection of hyperpyrexia at a CIT of 35.3Â°C provided sensitivity of 0.236 (0.143-0.359), specificity 0.977 (0.959-0.989), positive predictive value 0.589 (0.325-0.810), negative predictive value 0.904 (0.891-0.919), and accuracy of 0.888 (0.861-0.913). The use of a readily available CIT measurement device predicted hyperpyrexia about 59 percent of the time and the absence of hyperpyrexia about 90 percent of the time. This is consistent with previous reports of more complex infrared measurement devices. Although commonly used in mass fever screening, the current performance characteristics of CIT are limited and may add little to detection of target diseases in a mass screening context.The temperature limit defining fever (TLDF) is based on scarce evidence. This study aimed to determine the rate of fever in neutropenia (FN) episodes additionally diagnosed by lower versus standard TLDF. In a single center using a high TLDF (39.0Â°C tympanic temperature, LimitStandard), pediatric patients treated with chemotherapy for cancer were observed prospectively. Results of all temperature measurements and CBCs were recorded. The application of lower TLDFs (LimitLow; range, 37.5Â°C to 38.9Â°C) versus LimitStandard was simulated in silicon, resulting in three types of FN: simultaneous FN, diagnosed at both limits within 1 hour; earlier FN, diagnosed >1hour earlier at LimitLow; and additional FN, not diagnosed at LimitStandard. In 39 patients, 8896 temperature measurements and 1873 CBCs were recorded during 289 months of chemotherapy. Virtually applying LimitStandard resulted in 34 FN diagnoses. The predefined relevantly (â¥15%) increased FN rate was reached at LimitLow 38.4Â°C, with total 44 FN, 23 simultaneous, 11 earlier, and 10 additional (Poisson rate ratioAdditional/Standard, 0.29; 95% lower confidence bound, 0.16). Virtually applying 37.5Â°C as LimitLow led to earlier FN diagnosis (median, 4.5 hours; 95% CI, 1.0 to 20.8), and to 53 additional FN diagnosed. In 51 (96%) of them, spontaneous defervescence without specific therapy was observed in reality. Lower TLDFs led to many additional FN diagnoses, implying overtreatment because spontaneous defervescence was observed in the vast majority. Lower TLDFs led as well to relevantly earlier diagnosis in a minority of FN episodes. The question if the high TLDF is not only efficacious but as well safe remains open.To evaluate the role of serum level of procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and white blood cell count (WBC) as predictors in postoperative early infectious complications with fever after posterior lumbar internal fixation (PLIF). A retrospective study was conducted from January 2012 to January 2014. Fifty-two patients with fever in the early stage(within 10 days) after the PLIF were collected in the study. They were divided into infection group and non-infection group (group A and group B) according to the results of postoperative blood culture. There were 26 patients in group A and 32 patients in group B. The values of PCT, CRP, ESR, and WBC count were compared and analyzed between two groups. The values of PCT, CRP, and ESR in group A were higher than those of group B. Meanwhile, CRP and ESR in group B were still higher than the normal range. Among the 26 patients with infections (group A), PCT was superior to CRP and ESR, had a good ability in discriminating different kinds of postoperative infections. The area under the ROC curve of serum PCT levels was the largest (CI 95% was 0.81 to 0.98) in the indexs; and ROC curve of WBC count was no statistically significant. When the cut off points of each predictors were evaluated, the higher sensitive was CRP and reached at 90.27% and the higher specific was ESR and reached at 88.50%. For the patients with fever at the early stage after the PLIF should be paid attention and reasonable choosing predictors are helpful to identify postoperative infection in the early stage. The CRP and ESR may be influenced by the surgery, and the PCT level is helpful to differentiate infection type.PFAPA (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis) syndrome is the most common autoinflammatory syndrome in pediatrics, accepted as an hyperimmune condition. Pidotimod is a molecule with immunomodulatory activity on both innate and adaptive immune responses; it also has the capacity to modulate the function of the respiratory epithelial cells through the activation of a NK-KB pathway which would involve the host-virus interaction. Moreover, the proven beneficial effect of Pidotimod in enhancing the immune response during vaccination, and its benefits in the prevention of respiratory tract infections, should be noted. A joint combination of Pidotimod and bacterial lysates was used to treat 37 children with a clinical diagnosis of PFAPA; within the end of the first year of therapy, the healing rate of PFAPA symptoms was 67.5% (25 children), with a 10.8% (4 cases) still in complete remission within the end of the second year of follow-up. It is important to highlight that 29 children (78.3%) had benefitted from this therapy, in terms of healing, with a marked decrease in the incidence of fever from a total of 360 to 106 episodes, and episodes of periodic fever occurring almost 4 times less frequently. The use of Pidotimod determined a significant reduction of surgical tonsillectomy's treatment. This approach had a strong impact on the children's quality of life; a significant decrement in the use of antipyretic drugs, as well as a lower rate of antibiotic prescription, were also noted. It also had a dramatic impact on families' lives, because the treatment lowers the number of absences of family members from work or school/kindergarten.To explore Turkish parents' practices in childhood fever management. A cross-sectional study with 205 randomly selected Turkish parents of febrile children 6-months to 5-years from the paediatric hospital and two family health centres in Sakarya, Turkey in 2009. Data explored general fever management practices on the 8-item Parents' Fever Management Scale - Turkish version (5-point Liket scale; 1=never to 5=always) and socio-demographics. Parents wanted to know their child's temperature (61.5%), took temperatures (60%), slept in the same room (58.5%) and sought medical advice (53.7%). Non-evidence-based-practices included over-the-counter medications (42.4%); waking children during the night for fever reducing medication (33.2%). Evidence-based-practice ensured febrile children had plenty to drink (30.2%) and febrile children were checked during the night (59%). Parents' reports indicate high levels of concern about fever, overuse of over-the-counter medications and health services. Practices increase parents' burden of care, are disruptive of family life and lead to parental fatigue. The study confirms the appropriateness and applicability of the fever management instrument, a simple tool to incorporate into assessment of febrile children, in identifying Turkish parents' fever management practice.The immunological responses of patients with severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) remain largely unknown. We aim to study the magnitude and sustainability of host immune responses and their correlation with clinical, virological and hematological parameters. A longitudinal cohort study was performed in a SFTS reference hospital. The sequential immunological evaluation was determined for SFTSV infected patients, including anti-SFTSV IgM, IgG antibodies and the lymphocyte subsets. Altogether 298 laboratory-confirmed SFTS cases were analyzed, from whom 55 patients were followed after convalescence. SFTSV specific IgM antibody could be detected at medium of 9 days, surged to peak levels by 4 weeks, and remained persistent until 6 months after disease onset. SFTSV specific IgG antibody could be detected at medium of 6 weeks; surged to peak levels by 6 months, and remained positive in most of the patients even at 3 years after infection. SFTS patients experienced obvious T cell, B cell and NK cells loss during the first week of infection, which was rapidly restored to normal levels. A significantly lower level of humoral immunity was identified concurrently from severe disease, especially in acute phase of the infection. These abnormalities can be used as a potential indicator in the prediction of an adverse clinical outcome. Information gained from this study have clinical significance in enhancing our understanding of SFTS immunological characteristics and the disease pathogenesis.Malaria in highland areas of Kenya affects children and adults. Local clinicians include symptoms other than fever when screening for malaria because they believe that fever alone does not capture all cases of malaria. Individuals who presented to dispensaries in a highland Kenya site of low, unstable malaria transmission from 2007-2011 with 1 or more of 11 symptoms were tested by microscopy for malaria. Clinical malaria was defined as asexual Plasmodium falciparum infection on peripheral blood smear in an individual with any screening symptom. Asymptomatic P. falciparum infection was assessed in a cohort at ten time points to determine the extent to which symptomatic episodes with parasitaemia might be attributable to baseline (asymptomatic) parasitaemia in the community. 3,420 individuals were screened for malaria, 634â<â5 years of age and 2,786ââ¥â5 years of age. For the diagnosis of clinical malaria, the symptom of fever had a sensitivity and specificity of 88.9% and15.4% in children <5 years, and 55.8% and 54.4% in children â¥5 years, respectively. Adding the symptom of headache increased sensitivity to 94. 4% in children <5 years and 96.8% in individuals â¥5 years, but decreased specificity to 9.9% and 11.6%, respectively, and increased the number of individuals who would be tested by 6% and 92%, respectively. No combination of symptoms improved upon the presence fever or headache for detection of clinical malaria. In the cohort of asymptomatic individuals, P. falciparum parasitaemia was infrequent (0.1%). In areas of low, unstable malaria transmission, fever is a sensitive indicator of clinical malaria in children <5 years, but not in older children and adults. Adding headache to fever as screening symptom increases sensitivity of detection in individuals â¥5 years old at the cost of decreased specificity. Screening for symptoms in addition to fever may be required to accurately capture all cases of clinical malaria in individuals â¥5 years old in areas of low malaria transmission.Fever is common in the ICU among patients with severe brain injury. Fever has been consistently shown to exacerbate brain injuries in animal models and has been consistently associated with poor outcome in human studies. However, whether fever control improves outcome and the ideal means of fever control remain unknown. This review will address recent literature on the impact of fever on severe brain injury and on interventions to maintain normothermia. Current guidelines generally recommend maintenance of normothermia after brain injury but have scant recommendations on methods to do this. Observational trials have continued to demonstrate the association between fever and poor outcome after severe brain injury. Recent trials have shown the efficacy of more aggressive approaches to fever reduction, whereas a large randomized trial showed the relative ineffectiveness of acetaminophen alone for fever control. Several studies have also described the impact of fever and of fever control on brain physiology. The value of therapeutic normothermia in the neurocritical care unit (NCCU) is increasingly accepted, yet prospective trials that demonstrate a functional benefit to patients are lacking.Early diagnosis and timely treatment of malaria is recognized as a fundamental element to the control of the disease. Although access to health services in Tanzania is improved, still many people seek medical care when it is too late or not at all. This study aimed to determine factors associated with delay in seeking treatment for fever among children under five in Tanzania. A three-stage cluster sampling design was used to sample households with children under five in Dodoma region, central Tanzania between October 2010 and January 2011. Information on illness and health-seeking behaviours in the previous four weeks was collected using a structured questionnaire. A multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate determinants of delay in treatment-seeking behaviour while accounting for sample design. A total of 287 under-five children with fever whose caretakers sought medical care were involved in the study. Of these, 55.4% were taken for medical care after 24Â hours of onset of fever. The median time of delay in fever care seeking was two days. Children who lived with both biological parents were less likely to be delayed for medical care compared to those with either one or both of their biological parents absent from home (ORâ=â0.42, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.74). Children from households with two to three under-five children were more likely to be delayed for medical care compared to children from households with only one child (ORâ=â1.54, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.26). Also, children living in a distance â¥5 kilometres from the nearest health facility were about twice (95% CI: 1.11, 2.72) as likely to delay to be taken for medical care than those in the shorter distances. Living with non-biological parents, high number of under-fives in household, and long distance to the nearest health facility were important factors for delay in seeking healthcare. Programmes to improve education on equity in social services, family planning, and access to health facilities are required for better healthcare and development of children.Several classical swine fever (CSF) epidemics in wild boar and domestic pigs in Europe during the last decades have been caused by CSF virus (CSFV) strains of genotype 2.3. This genotype is known to be virulent leading to high morbidity and mortality. We experimentally infected two eight months old wild boar with 10(5,5) TCID50 of CSFV genotype 2.3 and kept the animals together with five noninoculated wild boar of the same age. Our original purpose was to evaluate a non-invasive sampling method based on saliva collection using \"rope-in-a-bait\" sampling baits. While expecting high morbidity, high level of virus shedding and some mortality, we actually observed a subclinical course of infection with an unexpected low contagiosity. The two inoculated animals infected only three contact animals while two contact animals remained uninfected. These findings substantially add to our epidemiological understanding of CSFV circulation in wild boar populations. CSFV infected animals older than six months and in good condition may not shed sufficient virus to transmit infection to all seronegative in-contact animals. The contagiosity in relation to the animal's age is discussed. This supports the hypothesis of silent perpetuation of CSFV in wild boar populations for several months if the wild boar density is sufficiently high. The feasibility of the \"rope-in-a-bait\" sampling method could be proven during the short viraemic phase of infected animals during the second week of infection.Advancements in the care of children with cancer have, in part, been achieved through improvements in supportive care. Situations that require prompt care can occur at the time of presentation as well as during treatment. This article discusses the approach to children with fever and neutropenia, a complication encountered daily by care providers, as well as oncologic emergencies that can be seen at the time of a child's initial diagnosis: hyperleukocytosis, tumor lysis syndrome, superior vena cava syndrome, and spinal cord compression.\n"
